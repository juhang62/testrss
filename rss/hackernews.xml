<title>NSO hacked WhatsApp to spy on top government officials at U.S. allies</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cyber-whatsapp-nsogroup/exclusive-whatsapp-hacked-to-spy-on-top-government-officials-at-u-s-allies-sources-idUSKBN1XA27H</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior government officials in multiple U.S.-allied countries were targeted earlier this year with hacking software that used Facebook Inc’s WhatsApp to take over users’ phones, according to people familiar with the messaging company’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20191031&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1447007016&amp;amp;r=LYNXMPEF9U1FO&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;FILE PHOTO: The WhatsApp messaging application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with WhatsApp’s internal investigation into the breach said a “significant” portion of the known victims are high-profile government and military officials spread across at least 20 countries on five continents. Many of the nations are U.S. allies, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacking of a wider group of top government officials’ smartphones than previously reported suggests the WhatsApp cyber intrusion could have broad political and diplomatic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Israeli hacking tool developer NSO Group. The Facebook-owned software giant alleges that NSO Group built and sold a hacking platform that exploited a flaw in WhatsApp-owned servers to help clients hack into the cellphones of at least 1,400 users between April 29, 2019, and May 10, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of WhatsApp users hacked could be even higher. A London-based human rights lawyer, who was among the targets, sent Reuters photographs showing attempts to break into his phone dating back to April 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is not clear who used the software to hack officials’ phones, NSO has said it sells its spyware exclusively to government customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some victims are in the United States, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Mexico, Pakistan and India, said people familiar with the investigation. Reuters could not verify whether the government officials were from those countries or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Indian nationals have gone public with allegations they were among the targets over the past couple of days; they include journalists, academics, lawyers and defenders of India’s Dalit community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSO said in a statement that it was “not able to disclose who is or is not a client or discuss specific uses of its technology.” Previously it has denied any wrongdoing, saying its products are only meant to help governments catch terrorists and criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity researchers have cast doubt on those claims over the years, saying NSO products were used against a wide range of targets, including protesters in countries under authoritarian rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen Lab, an independent watchdog group that worked with WhatsApp to identify the hacking targets, said on Tuesday at least 100 of the victims were civil society figures such as journalists and dissidents, not criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said it was not surprising that foreign officials would be targeted as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is an open secret that many technologies branded for law enforcement investigations are used for state-on-state and political espionage,” Scott-Railton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to notifying victims, WhatsApp checked the target list against existing law enforcement requests for information relating to criminal investigations, such as terrorism or child exploitation cases. But the company found no overlap, said a person familiar with the matter. Governments can submit such requests for information to WhatsApp through an online portal the company maintains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp has said it sent warning notifications to affected users earlier this week. The company has declined to comment on the identities of NSO Group’s clients, who ultimately chose the targets.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Restic – Backups Done Right</title>
<link>https://restic.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://restic.net/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;restic is a program that does backups right. The design goals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;12.552631578947&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy:&lt;/strong&gt; Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise you are tempted to skip it. Restic should be easy to configure and use, so that in the unlikely event of a data loss you can just restore it. Likewise, restoring data should not be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast:&lt;/strong&gt; Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by your network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files every day. Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring backups should only transfer data that is needed for the files that are to be restored, so that this process is also fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifiable:&lt;/strong&gt; Much more important than backup is restore, so restic enables you to easily verify that all data can be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.8210023866348&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure:&lt;/strong&gt; Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and integrity of your data. The location where the backup data is stored is assumed to be an untrusted environment (e.g. a shared space where others like system administrators are able to access your backups). Restic is &lt;a href=&quot;https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#design&quot;&gt;built to secure your data&lt;/a&gt; against such attackers, by encrypting it with AES-256 in counter mode and authenticating it using Poly1305-AES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient:&lt;/strong&gt; With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only take the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate data should be de-duplicated before it is actually written to the storage backend to save precious backup space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free:&lt;/strong&gt; restic is free software and licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/LICENSE&quot;&gt;BSD 2-Clause License&lt;/a&gt; and actively developed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/restic/restic/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;quickstart&quot;&gt;Quickstart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short recorded demo of restic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compatibility&quot;&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backward compatibility for backups is important so that our users are always able to restore saved data. Therefore restic follows &lt;a href=&quot;http://semver.org&quot;&gt;Semantic Versioning&lt;/a&gt; to clearly define which versions are compatible. The repository and data structures contained therein are considered the “Public API” in the sense of Semantic Versioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We guarantee backward compatibility of all repositories within one major version; as long as we do not increment the major version, data can be read and restored. We strive to be fully backward compatible to all prior versions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Some Blizzard employees are dreading BlizzCon</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-31/blizzard-employees-blizzcon-protests</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-31/blizzard-employees-blizzcon-protests</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Employees of Blizzard Entertainment always look forward to BlizzCon, the Irvine-based gaming company’s annual event for fans. Although preparing for it takes weeks of frenzied work, it’s a chance to debut games they’ve been toiling on, and the thousands of fans who pay more than $200 a ticket for entry treat anyone with an employee badge with reverence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“BlizzCon is sort of like the Christmas of Blizzard,” one staffer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were looking forward to this year’s edition, to be held Friday and Saturday in Anaheim, more than usual as a much-needed respite after a punishing and anxious 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2018, Mike Morhaime, the company’s beloved founder, &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/22549840/message-from-mike-morhaime-and-j-allen-brack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; as president. BlizzCon 2018, falling a few weeks later, was greeted by fans and gaming critics as a letdown, with the major product release, the mobile game “Diablo Immortal,” &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/blizzard-says-it-wasnt-expecting-fans-to-be-this-angry-1830204721&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drawing jeers&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in February, came the heaviest blow yet: &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-activision-blizzard-20190212-story.html&quot;&gt;the layoff of roughly 800 people&lt;/a&gt;, or about 8% of Activision Blizzard’s workforce. Coming after the company reported record-setting profits, bringing in $7.5 billion in revenue in 2018, it was a shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some employees who made it through the past 12 months, this year’s BlizzCon represented an opportunity for a do-over, a reset — a “make-up baby,” as the staffer put it. It could mark the end of a difficult era for Blizzard and the beginning of a promising new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then everything got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early October, with Blizzcon less than a month away, esports player Blitzchung appeared on a Taiwanese broadcast for a post-match interview in a gas mask and goggles, and yelled in support of the pro-democracy protests roiling Hong Kong. &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-10-08/blizzard-punishes-pro-gamer-for-supporting-hong-kong-protests&quot;&gt;As punishment,&lt;/a&gt; the company kicked him out of the tournament, revoked his $10,000 in winnings and banned him from “Hearthstone” esports for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the perceived curtailment of free expression by an American company with partial Chinese ownership, an army of gamers took to Reddit to howl their outrage and #BoycottBlizzard trended on Twitter. As the furor mounted, U.S. senators &lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ronwyden/status/1181637167749193729?s=21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called out the company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; for abandoning free speech values and bowing to the Chinese government in exchange for a “quick buck.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees said they have fielded venomous backlash on social media and in emails and been confronted by passersby while wearing company apparel off Blizzard’s campus. Now they are bracing for in-person protests as Blizzard ramps up security for BlizzCon, according to internal emails and accounts from three current employees and two former employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the matter and feared professional repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staffer who compared BlizzCon to Christmas said the prospect of protests has “poisoned” anticipation for this year’s event. “A lot of people that would’ve been happy and excited are now feeling dread that something’s going to happen,” he said. “You don’t know if it’s going to be people chanting outside. You don’t know if it’s going to be someone onstage. You don’t know if it’s going to be something dangerous that might actually hurt people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Dustin Blackwell, a Blizzard Entertainment spokesman, said, “BlizzCon has always been a place where we celebrate the passion and diversity of the Blizzard community, where we encourage and support the many creative and thoughtful ways attendees share and reflect their views and interests — and this year will be no different....The safety and security of our attendees is and has always been a top priority, and every year we iterate with new measures to bring our event even more up to date while doing everything we can to create a comfortable environment for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Blizzard, the reaction to the company’s punishment of Blitzchung was immediate but far from uniform. On the morning of Oct. 9 at the company’s campus in Irvine, roughly 30 employees walked out in protest. From 10 a.m. until around 6 p.m. they huddled around a 12-foot-tall statue of an orc that stands in the center of a courtyard. A creature from fantasy, the orc is seen as a symbol of Blizzard’s offbeat culture. Although it was a sunny day, many protesters &lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfqbql/blizzard_employees_protesting_the_companys/f35urqu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brandished umbrellas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a symbol of resistance in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have roiled the streets for months. (A wave of protests in 2014 were dubbed “the Umbrella Revolution.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, inside the buildings strewn around campus, there was a less visible discussion taking place, on the internal messaging system Slack, which the company had recently started using. &lt;em&gt;Was the company’s decision appropriate? Should Blizzard walk back its punishment?&lt;/em&gt; employees wondered, according to one employee who participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the company, the loudest voices expressed certitude that Blizzard had done something wrong. But within its walls, the discussion was more nuanced, with some believing the critics were holding Blizzard and its parent Activision — which is worth 42.8 billion and employs a workforce of roughly 9,000 — to an unfair standard. Many workers defended the decision, and the discussion at times grew heated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of differing opinions on what role political speech has within Blizzard,” an employee said. “Is (there) a moral imperative to do the right thing — do we just provide fantasies for people to set their real life aside?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As rank-and-file workers debated the right course of action and watched backlash grow online, they waited for words of explanation or encouragement from Blizzard’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until after nearly four days the company broke its silence with &lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23185888/regarding-last-weekend-s-hearthstone-grandmasters-tournament&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a statement from J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, President of Blizzard Entertainment, walking back the worst of the punishment it had issued for Blitzchung, whose real name is Ng Wai Chung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The length of Ng’s ban was cut to six months, down from one year, and the company said it would give him the $10,000 in prize winnings it had revoked, since Ng had “played fair.” Ng could participate in the next Hearthstone Grandmaster’s tournament if he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Externally, the statement, in which the company said it would continue to enforce limits on non-gaming speech in official company broadcasts, did little to reduce the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prominent former Blizzard employee Mark Kern, who led the team that created “World of Warcraft,” &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Grummz/status/1183215204525412352&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the statement was ludicrous legalese that only reinforced the idea that the company will restrict players’ speech if it offends the Chinese government. (Earlier, Kern had called for a boycott of Blizzard.) A bipartisan group of U.S. congressional members &lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/101819%20Wyden%20Letter%20to%20Activision%20Blizzard%20RE%20Hong%20Kong.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signed a letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; calling on the company to reconsider its stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group, declared a protest at BlizzCon and called for a blanket protest of companies that acquiesce to the Chinese government’s interests. A Facebook event titled &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1311063005738686/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Raid Blizzcon 2019 Dressed as Winnie The Pooh&lt;/a&gt; started as a joke but developed into plans for a real protest as hundreds of people RSVP’d. (Winnie the Pooh is a protest meme in China, as Chinese President Xi Jinping is said to bristle at the supposed resemblance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brack’s statement helped to dissipate some anger internally, and discussion shifted in Slack channels from debate about the company’s actions to managing repercussions for BlizzCon, as staff have busied themselves with preparations for the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One current employee and two former employees described Blizzard as a workplace where political discussions are mostly reserved for private conversations, not played out in public forums as they &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-vs-google-how-nonstop-political-arguments-rule-its-workplace-1525190574&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;famously are&lt;/a&gt;, or at least &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-puts-curbs-on-political-debate-by-employees-11566576970&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;used to be&lt;/a&gt;, at Google and other Silicon Valley companies that encourage employees to “bring their whole selves to work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against that backdrop, the idea of asking gamers to keep politics out of official streams did not seem absurd to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some employees also saw Blizzard as unfairly singled out for its Chinese ties. Tencent, a massive Chinese company, owns a partial stake in Activision Blizzard, fueling unsubstantiated social media claims that Tencent was behind the decision to punish Ng. But competitor Riot Games is fully owned by Tencent, which also owns a 40% stake in Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blizzard is not the only company that has a lot of ties to China,” one employee said. “Blizzard is just the first one that got their hand caught in the cookie jar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tough punishment meted out to Blitzchung was less a sign of obeisance to China than a symptom of a subtler shift in company culture, said three current and former employees who believe Blizzard has become increasingly corporate and less focused on its values and its people since Morhaime’s departure. One former employee pointed to the way &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/blizzard-ceo-addresses-gamergate-saga-in-everything-but-1656029155&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Morhaime took a stand against the #GamerGate movement&lt;/a&gt;, a harassment campaign against a female game developer and a proxy for backlash against inclusion and diversity in the gaming community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lingering nostalgia for Morhaime and his more accessible leadership style has contributed to a feeling among some employees that Blizzard is no longer run by Blizzard executives, but rather controlled by its Activision parent, based in Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Reynolds, publishing director of Global Esports at Blizzard Entertainment, declined to comment on the company’s leadership style but pointed to a &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tenet in Blizzard’s mission statement&lt;/a&gt; that reads “Every Voice Matters,” and encourages every employee to “speak up, listen, be respectful of other opinions, and embrace criticism as just another avenue for great ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With BlizzCon looming, Blizzard management has made some attempts to ease mounting employee concerns in messages reviewed by the Times. In early October, Chief Security Officer Mark Adams sent an email notifying employees of increased security guards and patrols because of protesters gathered outside the campus. Executive producer of BlizzCon Saralyn Smith sent a follow-up on Oct. 18 to assuage concerns about potential security threats at BlizzCon. Smith wrote that she and Adams would host a town hall in the coming weeks, although it couldn’t be confirmed whether the town hall happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackwell, the Blizzard spokesman, said in a statement that the company welcomes “open, constructive, and civil discussion of different perspectives at the show.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlizzCon, attendees who want to gauge the mood inside the company for themselves will have the opportunity at a session titled Life at Blizzard: Career and Culture Insights. It’s a programming decision that struck at least one ex-employee, who was laid off from Activision in February, as questionable given the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[D]o you think, of all the years, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the year you do a panel about working at Blizzard?” she tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times staff writers Jeff Bercovici and Sam Dean contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;article__text--dropcap&quot;&gt;The call came about 10 minutes before we were set to check into the Airbnb. I was sitting at a brewery just around the corner from the rental on North Wood Street in Chicago when the man on the other end of the line said that our planned visit wouldn’t be possible. A previous guest had flushed something down the toilet, which had left the unit flooded with water, he explained. Apologetic, he promised to let us stay in another property he managed until he could call a plumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had flown with two friends to the city in hopes of a relaxing end-of-summer getaway. We had purchased tickets to attend the September music festival Riot Fest, where Blink-182 and Taking Back Sunday were scheduled to perform. The trip had gotten off to a rough start even before the call. Around a month before, a first Airbnb host had already canceled, leaving us with little time to figure out alternative housing. While scrambling to find something else, I stumbled upon a local Airbnb rental listed by a couple, Becky and Andrew. Sure, the house looked a little basic in the photos online, but it was nice enough, especially considering the time crunch—light-filled, spacious, and close to the Blue Line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we were facing our second potential disaster in 30 days, and I couldn’t help but feel slightly suspicious of the man on the phone, who had called me from a number with a Los Angeles area code. Hoping to talk in person, I asked him if he was in the area. He said that he was at work and didn’t really have time to chat. Then he added that I needed to decide immediately if I was willing to change my reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if he could hear me calculating in my head how much of a hassle it would be to find a hotel instead, he then added something else to his pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s about three times bigger,” the man said. “That’s the good news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news, which went unstated, was that I had unknowingly stumbled into a nationwide web of deception that appeared to span eight cities and nearly 100 property listings—an undetected scam created by some person or organization that had figured out just how easy it is to exploit Airbnb’s poorly written rules in order to collect thousands of dollars through phony listings, fake reviews, and, when necessary, intimidation. Considering Airbnb’s lax enforcement of its own policies, who could blame the scammers for taking advantage of the new world of short-term rental platforms? They had every reason to believe they could do so with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you ever worked at Airbnb? Have you ever been scammed by someone exploiting a short-term rental platform? We'd love to hear from you. Send Allie Conti an &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:allieconti89@gmail.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or DM her on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/allie_conti&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. You also can send us a message on Signal at (310) 614-3752.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572358339276-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-20137-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572358339276-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-20137-PM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how Becky and Andrew advertised the Airbnb I ended up staying in for two nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I could see on my phone, the photos he sent looked fine enough, and finding myself again in a last-minute pinch, I reluctantly agreed. My one condition was that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/1570017743airbnbagreement.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;put in writing what we’d agreed&lt;/a&gt; to verbally: that I’d move back into the original listing as soon as possible, or be refunded for half of my trip if the plumbing issue couldn’t be resolved. He agreed, and I accepted a change to my reservation through Airbnb’s messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We popped the new address into Uber and took off, but when the driver approached the drop-off location, we noticed something odd: That exact address didn’t exist. After walking up and down North Kenmore Avenue, we were able to find a guest house hidden in a back alley that had a keypad on its front door. Once inside, we discovered what looked more like a flophouse than someone’s home. While, at three levels, it was quite big, almost everything else seemed off. The pantry housed a single bottle of soy sauce. The couch looked nothing like the one in the photos. The bedroom was filled with a large number of bizarrely arranged beds. The whole place felt grimy, and there was a hole punched in a wall. The only decor was a giant wooden cross and a few pieces of generic Chicago-themed artwork, and the dining room's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Boris-Contemporary-LeatherAdjustable-Barstool-Set-of-4/10036871/product.html?option=15157325&amp;amp;refccid=ZPWGDGCEPDMKKJCDW6XCSJRAZ4&amp;amp;searchidx=176&amp;amp;kwds=&amp;amp;rfmt=product%20features%3ASwivel%7Cstyle%3AModern%20%26amp%3B%20Contemporary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Overstock.com barstools&lt;/a&gt; looked as if they would turn into dust if you sat on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By then, it was already late in the afternoon. With the first day of my vacation basically gone, I decided to let the whole thing slide. But the next day, we got a text from the man, who said that the plumbing in the original rental hadn’t been fixed, but that new tenants were moving into our flophouse the next day. Not quite sure what to do, we booked a hotel and decided to deal with getting a refund later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I heard from Becky and Andrew, they sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/09/157063343310_AM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a strange message on Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; asking that I give them no less than a five-star review⁠—since Airbnb had “changed its algorithm”⁠—and that I communicate all concerns privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I respectfully request that you let me know about any challenges you faced with my property directly on this message thread rather than write a 4 star review [sic],” they wrote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked about the status of my refund, they ghosted, which led me to contact Airbnb. Though I had been moved to a flophouse and then told to leave early, Airbnb only refunded me $399 of my $1,221.20, and only did so after I badgered a number of case managers over the course of several days. The $399 didn’t even include the service fees Airbnb charged me for the pleasure of being thrown out on the street. But my power was nothing compared to that of a company valued this year at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2019/3/19/18272274/airbnb-valuation-common-stock-hoteltonight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$35 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and I figured it was probably the best I could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__text--dropcap&quot;&gt;I was thankful I’d gotten the last-minute agreement in writing, but I also started to wonder what had actually happened in Chicago. Unable to shake the sense that this was more than a run-of-the-mill bad host, I started to look for red flags I must have missed. It didn’t take long to find a few. For one, the phone number that the Airbnb host had called me with was a Google number that couldn’t be traced. Through a reverse image search, I also realized that the profile picture Becky and Andrew had used on Airbnb was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/28/157227664200_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stock photo from a website that hosts surfing-themed desktop wallpapers&lt;/a&gt;. And when I started going through other people’s reviews of Becky and Andrew’s properties, I noticed some other renters had reported experiences that strangely mirrored my own. A woman said she was forced to switch up her itinerary three minutes before check-in due to alleged plumbing issues. A man said that he was promised a refund because his rental was “falling apart,” though it never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572358419947-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-15713-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572358419947-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-15713-PM.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photo for Becky and Andrew's account popped up elsewhere on the internet after a reverse image search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even some of the positive reviews of Becky and Andrew’s Chicago rentals seemed odd, especially those left by other pairs of hosts. Kelsey and Jean, for example, said Becky and Andrew were “awesome and communicative guests.” But they &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/29/157238569135_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;themselves were based in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, where it seemed they had at least two properties of their own. Why would they need to rent from someone else there? Even stranger, Kelsey and Jean’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/157004632144_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; also had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/157004630945_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cribbed from a travel site&lt;/a&gt;, and the language they used to describe their home (“Westloop 6 Bed Getaway - Walk the City”) seemed similar to that of Becky and Andrew’s (“6 Bed Downtown / Wicker Park / Walk the City”). It wasn’t long before I found what looked an awful lot like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966599beckyandandrew.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;apartment I’d originally booked&lt;/a&gt; with Becky and Andrew—the one on North Wood Street—&lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966640kelseyandjean.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;listed by Kelsey and Jean&lt;/a&gt; as well. There was no mistaking it: The couch, coffee table, dining room set, and wall art were all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to wonder whether “Becky and Andrew” and “Kelsey and Jean” existed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to figure out if Becky and Andrew and &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966640kelseyandjean.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kelsey and Jean&lt;/a&gt; had the same unit as &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966656alexandbrittany.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966676rachelandpete.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966619krisandbecky.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;couples&lt;/a&gt;, or if they just had the same detailing around the windows and a bunch of the same furniture pieces in different arrangements. Kris and Becky’s unit looked identical, save for a coffee table that was rectangular instead of round. Alex and Brittany had an additional armchair in their living room. Rachel and Pete’s place showed the most variation, but was still eerily similar to the rest of the bunch. When I finally plugged the original address of the place that I’d booked from Becky and Andrew into Google Street View, I felt like I was losing my mind. Becky and Andrew’s photos had no floor-to-ceiling windows, but the building on Street View at the same address clearly did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572358553428-I-Accidentally-Uncovered-a-Sprawling-Nationwide-Scam-on-Airbnb_Circle_Collage_Desktop-1&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572358553428-I-Accidentally-Uncovered-a-Sprawling-Nationwide-Scam-on-Airbnb_Circle_Collage_Desktop-1.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The listings from these different accounts are all similar but shot at different angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed as if one person or group might have created numerous phony accounts to run a much larger Airbnb operation. If that proved true, it meant whoever ran the five accounts I’d located was controlling at least 94 properties in eight different cities. How many other people who had been scammed out of money like me? Feeling as if I was entering Pynchonian nightmare, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/1570018017metoairbnb.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sent a message to Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; alerting them to what increasingly seemed like an elaborate scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Airbnb, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2019/09/19/airbnb-initial-public-offering-2020/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plans to go public next year&lt;/a&gt;, seemed to have little interest in rooting out the rot from within its own platform. When I didn’t hear back from the company after a few days, and saw that the suspicious accounts were still active, I took it upon myself to figure out who exactly had ruined my vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__text--dropcap&quot;&gt;I wanted to know who owned the building we ended up staying in, but couldn’t find much on the county property assessor’s website except that the LLC that owned the house had an association with lawyers in Chicago and New York. Figuring that I needed to find the addresses of some of the other properties in order to discern who owned them, I decided to track down other people who had left negative reviews of Becky and Andrew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person I reached out to was Jane Patterson, of Holland, Michigan. She called me back almost immediately, saying that she had gotten scammed by Becky and Andrew earlier this year and had been unable to stop thinking about it since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hadn’t had much Airbnb experience when she and her daughter decided to book a place in Marina del Rey, California, this past spring, she said. But as a criminal defense attorney, she figured she had a pretty good barometer for bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before check-in, Patterson had gotten a call that was almost exactly the same as the one I had received. The man on the other end of the line said that the property’s bathroom wasn’t working, but that he was able to put them up in a much bigger place until a plumber could fix the problem. It was inconvenient, but also an invitation to stay at what sounded like a mansion in one of the most exclusive areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were like, ‘Shit, it’s in Malibu, what the heck?’” Patterson recalled. “We looked at the pictures and thought it was a great deal for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they arrived, they realized it wasn’t. The front door had been left unlocked, which Patterson described as “creepy,” and it was dirty and filled with furniture that looked like it had been picked up off the street. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569973838IMG_8351.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;couches were tattered&lt;/a&gt;, the armchairs were &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/156997466616_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;burned by cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569973819IMG_8352.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tables were banged-up&lt;/a&gt;—details I confirmed through photos she’d taken at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572358655264-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-25334-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572358655264-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-25334-PM.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Patterson refused to stay in Becky and Andrew's supposed upgrade after determining it was run down and dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterson said she left a message at the contact number she’d been given for Becky and Andrew to say that she wouldn’t stay in such a place. Though the person who answered the phone said they’d get back to her about the issues she described, they never did. After retreating to the house of a friend who happened to live nearby, she began the process of requesting a refund for the trip “pretty much right away”—one she believed her profession undoubtedly gave her a huge leg up on obtaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbnb’s refund policy is based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;complicated rubric&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t say guests need written evidence in order to obtain a full refund but does note the company has “final say in all disputes.” It’s easy enough to see how a scammer might exploit the policies as laid out. If a guest stays even one night in a rental, for example, it is difficult to obtain a full refund, according to Airbnb’s rules. If a host asks a guest to stay at a property that’s different from the one they rented, Airbnb &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/250/what-if-a-host-informs-me-that-the-listing-i-already-paid-for-is-now-unavailable-but-they-have-an-alternative&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; the guest to request a cancellation if they’re “not okay with the switch.” In both cases, the rules favor a would-be scammer and place the onus on guests who have just parachuted into an unfamiliar locale with their luggage and have nowhere else to stay that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Airbnb looked over Patterson’s pictures, a company representative told her that Becky and Andrew had a right to respond to the complaint, she told me. A few days later, Airbnb offered her a partial refund. Many people might have reluctantly walked away with whatever money they got back to avoid a prolonged battle. After all, Airbnb uses a rating system in which both the host and tenant can publicly provide feedback to one another, which both parties then use to prove their credibility in the future. Because of that, there is a built-in incentive to avoid confrontation, which helps explain &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2554500&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;why Airbnb hosts consistently receive higher ratings than hotels reviewed on TripAdvisor&lt;/a&gt;, according to research out of Boston University and the University of Southern California. If a customer has a negative experience on Airbnb, they might be better off just moving on instead of leaving a negative review. Choose the latter option, and you could come across as too demanding by other prospective hosts, or, in extreme cases, even receive a retaliatory review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Patterson didn’t care about that. She knew she had been scammed and wasn’t going to stand down until she received every penny back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m an attorney, so I love to argue,” she said. “I just didn’t stop calling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She eventually got her full refund, but it indeed came with a harsh review from Becky and Andrew for doing so. “We would NOT host or recommend her to the airbnb community!!” they wrote. Patterson couldn’t help but wonder how people with fewer resources and no place to crash would have fared in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You think about these people who maybe saved up for six months to go to Marina del Rey for five days and have nowhere to stay,” Patterson said. “I can see how they can get some people who are trapped into staying in a shitty place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__text--dropcap&quot;&gt;That’s what happened to Juan David Garrido, a college student from St. Paul, Minnesota, who rented a place from Kris and Becky in Milwaukee this past Fourth of July weekend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrido had traveled to the city to attend a musical festival with friends, only to have the hosts cancel on him at the last minute. But Kris seemed eager to help him out, saying he had a place that was still available for rent and could easily fit seven guests. Finding himself in a pinch, Garrido remembered feeling immensely grateful and quickly booking the new spot⁠—so quickly, in fact, that he didn’t quite absorb the cost. Because of Garrido’s large party, Kris and Becky had charged him almost $1,800 for three nights—roughly half of what he made in a full semester’s work study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrido cancelled the reservation, but didn’t read the fine print before doing so, triggering a $950 cancellation fee. He called up Kris and said that he’d stay there after all if he’d waive the fee. Kris verbally agreed, he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long after Garrido arrived that he realized he was probably never going to get his cancellation fee refunded and that Kris wasn’t as helpful as he’d first seemed. “No one lived there,” he told me over the phone. “It was just beds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garrido tried to get his money back through Airbnb customer support for more than a week (he let me review the chain of correspondence). Because of his poor experience, an Airbnb customer representative refunded Garrido approximately $700 of the $1800 he spent on Kris and Becky’s listing, but explained the couple had the right to keep the cancellation fee since Garrido had not received the agreement to waive the fee in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria LaSota, 29, wasn’t even that lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a trip to Milwaukee from Chicago to celebrate her mom’s 60th birthday last July, she also rented a unit from Kris and Becky. She recounted over the phone how a man claiming to be Kris called her up just before check-in and said that he had accidentally double-booked. He needed to move her party to a bigger unit he managed on the same street. LaSota didn’t really feel she had much of a choice. It was a busy weekend in the city, what with the Chicago Cubs playing the Milwaukee Brewers and annual Summerfest musical festival taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the other properties, LaSota’s rental was a mess—covered in sawdust and without the amenities needed to even open and drink a bottle of wine they’d brought to celebrate the occasion. “You could tell the apartment was just staged for pictures,” she said. The king-sized bed only came with throw pillows and a fitted sheet. The gas stove wasn’t hooked up. There was no air-conditioning, and they couldn’t open the windows because there were no screens. There were also no curtains, which meant anyone who walked past could see straight inside. But they didn’t have anywhere else to go, so they stayed anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there, she met a few men at the bar down the street from the rental who mentioned that they were also staying at an Airbnb in the same building. “It turned out the same thing had happened to them,” LaSota said. “They were originally supposed to have the unit we were staying in, and there was still a construction crew there, so they were moved to a place upstairs that was smaller and didn’t fit all the guys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They got the call 10 minutes before they arrived,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following week, LaSota received a call thanking her for being such a good guest. The man on the other end of the line said his name was Kris, but it was clearly not the same person she’d spoken to previously, LaSota said. After LaSota started mentioning the problems with the unit, the man said he was confused and needed to call his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘Your wife or the other guy’s wife?’” LaSota said. “‘The guy who called me last week told me his name was Kris, too, and your tone of voice and accent are completely different.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man hung up on her, and she never heard from him again. Soon after, however, “Kris and Becky” left a review complaining that she’d left beer bottles all over the house and even harassed people. (“They tried to say I threw a wild party,” LaSota said. “I was with four 60-year-old women.”) Distressed, she &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/1570020084IMG_6893.jpeg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tried to report the couple to Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; through its customer support system. The case manager told her over the phone on the first day in August that she would hear something from the company within eight weeks; she’s still heard nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaSota’s story tracked with what I’d seen online. When people had written bad reviews of “Becky and Andrew” in the past, the hosts would turn around and claim that the renters themselves were scammers or inexperienced travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572380641514-1&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572380641514-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people complain about Becky and Andrew's properties, the hosts insult them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was another thing about LaSota’s story that caught my attention. The fact that the Airbnb host was able to shuffle both LaSota’s family and the men at the bar around the same building made me wonder whether the hosts owned the property in its entirety, which would increase the likelihood of the schemer’s name appearing in the public record. When I looked up the address on the property appraiser’s website, I got the name of yet another LLC, which I plugged into the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions’ website. Such sites are where you find the name of the registered agent, or the person who handles legal documents for the company. Usually, you’ll get the name of a lawyer who’s under no obligation to reveal information about their clients to a reporter over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this case, the profile I was looking at didn’t belong to a lawyer. It belonged to someone named Shray Goel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked up Goel on LinkedIn, I found that he was based in Los Angeles, and described himself as &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/04/157020382940_AM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the director of an “upscale corporate rental company” named Abbot Pacific LLC&lt;/a&gt;. Another man named Shaun Raheja ran the business alongside him, according to Raheja’s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/04/157020387224_AM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; page. Goel’s YouTube page features videos of him &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/08/157054987412_AM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;touring run-down properties&lt;/a&gt;, including one at the same address Garrido and LaSota told me that they stayed at in Milwaukee. On his Instagram page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/28/157227842037_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he listed himself&lt;/a&gt; as a “long distance real estate investor” who works in “LA, Chicago, Nashville, Austin, Dallas, Milwaukee, Indiana, and Orlando.” Those eight cities overlap with properties tied to “Becky and Andrew” and the other accounts. For his part, Raheja’s public Instagram features &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/157001909339_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/156997701623_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/03/157011516137_AM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advertised by&lt;/a&gt; Kelsey and Jean on Airbnb. (Raheja didn’t respond to calls, emails, or direct messages over Twitter seeking comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572358856238-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-25454-PM&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572358856238-Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-25454-PM.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A YouTube user named Shray Goel has uploaded a video tour of the property two of Kris and Becky's customers stayed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked back through old reviews of the couples, I noticed something else that I hadn’t before. Back in 2012, a man had left a review on Kelsey and Jean’s page that had referred to them not as “Kelsey and Jean,” but as a single person: &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/29/157238594108_PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Shray.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shray is a delight to host,” the man wrote in the 2012 review. “And I would welcome him.back [sic] anytime! He is neat and tidy and very independent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was it. I was convinced I had found the scammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__text--dropcap&quot;&gt;I desperately wanted to know Goel’s side of the story, and repeatedly tried to reach him on his cell phone, to no avail. So I decided to call Abbot Pacific, the company he ran, according to LinkedIn. The company’s website only listed a Google number, which I called repeatedly on a Wednesday in October before leaving a voicemail explaining that I needed to speak with Goel. The next day, I emailed Goel on his personal Gmail. Less than two hours later, someone finally got back to me, but the man on the other end of the line said he wasn’t who I was looking for. He claimed his name was “Patrick.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just handle incoming phone calls” for Abbot Pacific, the man said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick told me that Goel had been bought out of the company nine months ago. Then the man started to pepper me with questions about this piece. “I Googled you very briefly, and it seems like you write generally negative things, so I’m just trying to figure out how I can help,” he said. The man asked me about my motivations, and for the names of the people I’d spoken to. I told him that I’d rather talk to Goel, and he said that he would work on getting me in touch with him, which he never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572380748549-3&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572380748549-3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbot Pacific's website was taken offline moments after I spoke with a man who said he answered phones for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 30 minutes after the call, I tried to go back on Abbot Pacific’s website. But I couldn’t. It had disappeared, replaced only five words in all caps: “THIS WEBSITE IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE.” I called “Patrick” back to ask what happened. “I think it went down yesterday,” he said. “We’re adding some new stuff to it. New properties and stuff like that.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told him that I had just been on the site moments before our initial conversation and found it strange that the website went down right after, he agreed that it was “weird.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Patrick what he used to do before becoming a secretary for Abbot Pacific, and he said that he was in property management. I asked if he had a LinkedIn, and he said that he did, though he declined to tell me his last name. (I could not find a “Patrick” who works at Abbot Pacific on LinkedIn.) I also offered to email him links to the Airbnb accounts I was referring to, but he never gave me an email address, saying that he had a pad and pen to take them down, which would presumably be a first in human history. I described the interviews I’d done so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I added something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, and I should say that this also happened to me,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several seconds of silence passed before Patrick responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This makes a lot more sense now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick said that Abbot Pacific did have properties on the street that Garrido and LaSota stayed on, though he noted that he wasn’t much involved with the Airbnb side of the business and that it was “ramping down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me make a few calls and figure out where this disconnect happened,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hanging up, I messaged Kris and Becky’s account and asked for Goel to call me because I was writing an article. It was around 3 p.m. in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hi Allie—Think you might be mistaken,” they wrote back four hours later. “Are you looking to book the home?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six hours after that, the prices for &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/04/1570204205image__16_.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;several of Kris and Becky’s properties&lt;/a&gt; rose to $10,000 a night—far too high to be seen by anyone searching for a short-term rental on a reasonable budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572380788885-4&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572380788885-4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I messaged Kris and Becky asking if they could put me in touch with Shray Goel, some of their properties shot up to $10,000 a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, Abbot Pacific’s website remains down. The man who called himself Patrick never called me back with more information about the “disconnect,” or put me in touch with Goel, as he said he would. I again emailed and called Goel myself. I texted him as well as messaged him on Facebook, and on the real estate investment forum BiggerPockets, but never got a response. It nevertheless appears he knew I wanted to talk to him. The day after I spoke with Patrick, Goel’s LinkedIn page had been completely scrubbed of any mention of Abbot Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__text--dropcap&quot;&gt;As it turned out, I had accidentally stumbled upon a larger, more metastasized version of what researchers at a Los Angeles-based advocacy organization uncovered themselves while researching Airbnb in the middle of the decade. In 2015, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laane.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AirBnB-Final.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy released a report&lt;/a&gt; that said large rental companies in Los Angeles had started to profit off Airbnb by creating pseudonyms that helped them appear to be normal homeowners. The most prolific host that LAANE identified in LA was “ghc,” or Globe Homes and Condos, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://globehomes.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;now-defunct company&lt;/a&gt; that at one time ran an Airbnb profile using the pseudonyms “Danielle and Lexi.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb’s Community Standards state that no host should “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finder.com/how-to-become-an-airbnb-host&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provide inaccurate information&lt;/a&gt;,” but Airbnb does not rigorously police the request, according to the report. “In spite of the fact that Danielle and Lexi received a verified ID, badge on their profile page, we have no way of knowing if they had any role in the properties other than having their photo taken,” the report stated. “This case also undermines one of the cornerstones of AirBnB’s business model, namely that the company’s ratings and identity verification system are a viable means by which travelers can vet their prospective hosts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Elmendorf, a senior policy analyst at LAANE, told me that Airbnb’s weak verification process created the opportunity for those who were willing to exploit the platform through the creation of “faux, just-like-you personas.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Airbnb does no checking up on this whatsoever,” said Elmendorf. “They’re one of the most sophisticated companies in the world, and you’re telling me they can’t come up with a system that prevents this? Airbnb is doing that hand-wavy thing that tech companies do where they say, ‘We can’t solve this.' If they wanted to solve it, they would figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem extends beyond my own scammer and beyond Los Angeles. The Better Business Bureau has received around 200 complaints about Airbnb through its “Scam Tracker” in the past three years, and about half of those were regarding fake profiles, spokesperson Katherine Hutt told me. The use of fake profiles does not necessarily translate into a bad customer experience. Many people don’t care whose home they’re staying in—they just want something cheaper than a hotel. But by allowing hosts to easily operate under fake identities, Airbnb has set up a system that allows scammers like mine to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling I had all the evidence I needed to prove my point to Airbnb, I emailed the company’s press team a long note, asking them, among other things, how they make sure that people are accurately representing themselves on their profiles and how case managers are directed to deal with allegations of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little more than 24 hours later, a company flak responded in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Engaging in deceptive behavior such as substituting one listing for another is a violation of our Community Standards,” the flak wrote. “We are suspending the listings while we investigate further.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; data-children-count=&quot;0&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=&quot; alt=&quot;1572380818447-5&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572380818447-5.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shray Goel removed Abbot Pacific from his LinkedIn page after I spoke with &quot;Patrick&quot; on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was it. No one at the company ever agreed to speak on the record about the specifics of what I uncovered. Nor would anyone answer any of my questions about Airbnb's verification process. As far as what obligation it has to people who have fallen victim to a scam on Airbnb's platform, the company only said in an email that it is &quot;here 24/7 to support with rebooking assistance, full refunds and reimbursements&quot; in cases of fraud or misrepresentation by hosts. Maybe Airbnb couldn't get more detailed about its verification process because it doesn't have much of one at all. I had asked the company about three accounts—Annie and Chase, Becky and Andrew, and Kris and Becky. Annie and Chase’s account has been deleted, and the two others no longer have any listings posted, which, due to Airbnb’s messaging constraints, means I could not message them for comment. Of the six other accounts I'd connected to the scheme, five are still active weeks later. Only Kelsey and Jean’s has disappeared from the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if my scammers had been slightly foiled, there was no guarantee that they couldn’t just start fresh with new profiles. The system was still in place. Airbnb has created a web of &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.airbnb.com/fast-facts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than 7 million listings&lt;/a&gt; built largely on trust, easily exploitable by those willing to do so. Maybe it’s not so surprising that the company would rather play a half-assed game of whack-a-mole than answer basic questions about their verification process. For every person who doesn’t receive a complete refund, Airbnb makes money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kellen Zale, a professor at the University of Houston who studies property law and short-term rentals, told me there’s no politician at the state or federal level who’s made all that much noise about Airbnb. Instead, the onus falls on local governments—some of which are too cash-strapped to put up much of a fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Airbnb &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/airbnb-san-francisco-proposition-f_n_56366676e4b0c66bae5cc3b6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spent at least $8 million on lobbying efforts&lt;/a&gt; to fight back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/19/airbnb-san-francisco-listings-cut-in-half/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB6DudPNMHzGwwcPT9c9ZhhlKoDIEXphptSp84fxFFgD1y25f4e3eVlgR8LNeJrmKMlLw-OcxciS5ccKjp5IS9MZYADJ2bDf5GsF-REj8jTC9J1eN3Yq6EEYijLL0Ihbu-lVELw5uSoyp1PrmyElaASx1I3LqpXXJtuNljLHS1ZD&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an ordinance in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; that required all Airbnb hosts to register their units with the city in a lengthy process. The ordinance passed anyway, severely reducing the number of properties available. But not all cities have San Francisco’s budgetary resources. When New Orleans &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nola.com/news/article_c390da62-ba00-11e9-b876-237e289ed3ef.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overhauled their short-term rental laws in August&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the budget-strapped city mostly left oversight of the new rules in the hands of Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the rest of us are left to deal with the fallout. Zale herself had a less-than-stellar experience with Airbnb a few years back. Her host gave her the wrong code to unlock the door to a property she’d rented in Texas, and she had to book an expensive hotel at the last minute. She said that despite being angry that Airbnb didn’t refund the cost of the hotel, she has stuck with the platform. She likes the “appeal of living in a neighborhood for a couple of nights,” she said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other people I spoke to are dealing with the same cognitive dissonance. They know that they’re rolling the dice with short-term rental startups, but feel they have no other choice. For her part, Patterson said she might switch to Vrbo, but LaSota is still trying to get a retaliatory review she received taken down ahead of an Italian vacation. Garrido said he anticipates a lifetime of fealty to Airbnb, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If I had another choice, I would not use Airbnb again,” he told me. “I was very put off by getting scammed. But at this point, I feel like if I want to travel, there’s not really much else I can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after a month of digging through public records, scouring the internet for clues, repeatedly calling Airbnb and confronting the man who called himself Patrick, I can’t say I’ll be leaving the platform, either. Dealing with Airbnb’s easily exploitable and occasionally crazy-making system is still just a bit cheaper than renting a hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, after all that, I never even left Becky and Andrew a review.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.piper.com/press-releases/piper-announces-new-m600-sls/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VERO BEACH, FL., October 30, 2019 –&lt;/strong&gt;Piper Aircraft announced today, the  next generation M Series aircraft – the M600 SLS, standard equipped with the new HALO™&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Safety System – enhancing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safety, Luxury, and Support &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;for one of the world’s leading personal use, Basic Med compliant aircraft.  It is now on track to be the first general aviation aircraft in the world to be certified with Autoland capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAFETY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HALO&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; Safety System is a compilation of innovative technologies unique to the M600 SLS and the Garmin G3000 avionics suite.  The system includes Auto-throttle, Emergency Descent Mode, Enhanced Stability and Protection, Surface Watch, Safe Taxi, Flight Stream connectivity and more. However, of greatest significance is the addition of Garmin Autoland – digital technology that safely lands the aircraft at the nearest suitable airport in the event that the pilot is incapacitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Halo system, once engaged either automatically or by a passenger, gains immediate situational awareness and assumes control of all systems necessary to bring you and your passengers safely to the best suited runway. During all phases of flight it communicates with passengers and appropriate air traffic control facilities regarding the new flight plan route and estimated time until landing.  Halo continually monitors all aircraft system parameters and real-time external inputs as if the pilot were at the controls.  It takes into account runway size and orientation, wind, time, fuel range, glide path and considers weather conditions and terrain en route to the nearest suitable runway. Once Halo has landed the aircraft, the braking system will activate and will bring the aircraft to a full and complete stop. Finally, the engine will shut down and instructions will be provided on how to exit the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LUXURY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M600 SLS raises the bar in Luxury with the addition of the EXP interior package as standard equipment.  The interior package was designed with a focus on the personal travel experience and enables the customer to select from sophisticated interior color palettes with custom materials, stitching patterns and contrasting threads.  Veneer and trim finishes further enhance the sense of unmatched refinement.   Additionally, thoughtfully designed interior options, like two toned leather seats and Alcantara fabric have been added to elevate the passenger experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ownership of a M600 SLS is backed by an exclusive service program for the first five years of ownership. The Ultimate Care Program includes all scheduled maintenance, as well as hourly and calendar-based inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The M600 SLS and its HALO™&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Safety System with Autoland is the result of an unwavering commitment to safety as well as the desire to evolve our products based on market input, said President and CEO, Simon Caldecott.  “The HALO System greatly enhances situational awareness and operational safety through the use of advanced technology and is one the most significant advancements in General Aviation history.  The team at Piper Aircraft is proud that we continue on track to be first to market with Garmin Autoland, which will ultimately help pave the way for others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certification of the M600 SLS is imminent with deliveries beginning this quarter through the global Piper Dealer network at a price point of $2.994M.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zuckerberg doubles down on Facebook political ads policy after Twitter ban</title>

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although I've considered whether we should not carry [political] ads in the past, and I’ll continue to do so, on balance so far I've thought we should continue,&quot; Zuckerberg told investors on a quarterly earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;dfp-ad-mosad_1-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;dfp-tag-wrapper wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ads can be an important part of voice — especially for candidates and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so they can get their message into debates,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook directed The Hill to Zuckerberg's remarks in response to an inquiry about Twitter's announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg and Facebook have been hit with a firestorm of criticism this month over its policy allowing politicians to lie in advertisements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several weeks, Zuckerberg has engaged in an unusually public charm offensive as he seeks to defend Facebook's ad practices against critics who have accused the company of profiting off of and even encouraging political misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg in the month of October offered interviews on Fox News and NBC, gave a public speech at Georgetown University, and testified before Congress about his view that Facebook should build policies to promote &quot;free expression.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tore into those arguments with the series of tweets announcing his company's policy change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;t's not credible for us to say: 'We’re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad…well...they can say whatever they want!'&quot; he wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1dbjc4n r-xoduu5 r-1mlwlqe r-1d2f490 r-1udh08x r-u8s1d r-h9hxbl r-417010&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;&quot;This isn’t about free expression,&quot; he added. &quot;This is about paying for reach.&quot;  
&lt;p&gt;He said Twitter would announce the policy officially in mid-November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg said Facebook believes &quot;transparency&quot; around political advertising is preferable to a ban on the ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would we really block ads for important political issues like climate change or women's empowerment?&quot; he asked. &quot;Instead, I believe the better approach is to work to increase transparency. Ads on Facebook are already more transparent than anywhere else.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is a dominant player in digital advertising, while Twitter has a much smaller role in the market. Political advertising is only a small percentage of both companies' total revenue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Build Your Own Thrust Vectored Rockets for Vertical Landings Like SpaceX</title>
<link>https://makezine.com/2019/10/25/build-your-own-thrust-vectored-rockets-for-vertical-landings-like-spacex/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://makezine.com/2019/10/25/build-your-own-thrust-vectored-rockets-for-vertical-landings-like-spacex/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you love rockets, you can’t help but notice that real space launch vehicles lift off the pad slowly,but model rockets zip up like darts. That’s how I became obsessed with using thrust vector control (TVC) — gimbaling the rocket motor — instead of fins to keep model rockets upright, so they can launch, and land, far more realistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZERO TO ROCKETEER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out from scratch in rocketry; I’m all self-taught. After graduating with a degree in audio engineering from Berklee College of Music in 2014, I saw what SpaceX and other aerospace companies were going for with propulsive landing technology and I was hooked. I knew I wanted to get into rocketry to get a job at one of these companies, and I wasn’t in a position to pay for another college degree. I figured instead I could demonstrate what I was teaching myself by propulsively landing a model rocket the same way SpaceX landed the Falcon 9. It was a literal “shower idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started BPS in 2015 with the goal of achieving vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) of a scale model Falcon 9 rocket. This would require me to solve two tough problems — thrust-vectored flight and propulsive landings — using solid-fuel hobby rocket motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a few textbooks (I strongly recommend Rocket Propulsion Elements by George Sutton and Structures by J.E. Gordon), found a few good YouTube tutorials for coding and mechanical design, and got to work experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_547274&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?ssl=1&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif?ssl=1&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?resize=2500%2C600&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-547274&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-547274 size-full&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?w=2500&amp;amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?resize=620%2C149&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?resize=768%2C184&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?resize=1024%2C246&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?resize=90%2C22&amp;amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?resize=300%2C72&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AllFlightComputers.jpg?w=2000&amp;amp;ssl=1 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-547274&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;BPS has produced a lot of rocketry flight computers. Like maybe way too many. Here they are in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I naïvely thought it would take four months. My first ten launches were failures. But the eleventh succeeded, and the successes accelerated after that. After four years of hard work, crashes, and iterative designs, I’m now achieving beautiful thrust-vectored launches of several rockets, including my 1:48-scale Falcon Heavy — three cores! — that you can watch on my YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after some very near misses, I’m confident my Echo rocket will stick the vertical landing in 2019. Rather than attempt to throttle a solid-fuel motor, I’m firing the entire retro motor —also TVC’ed —at the precise time and altitude to enable a soft touchdown. It hasn’t been easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KITS FOR MAKERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this technology is still not mature, and it’s my hope that the advanced model rocketry community will build upon what I’ve done. In 2017, I began selling my Signal flight computer board and TVC motor mount together in a kit. After getting user feedback, the computer was redesigned from the ground up to include Bluetooth — Mission Control from your phone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BPS.space is now a proper company and a full-time job for me, funded through flight computer sales, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/bps_space&quot;&gt;BPS.space Patreon page&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube ad revenue, and sponsorships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kit is for advanced rocketeers. If you don’t have experience with scratch-built rockets, I recommend you hone your skills first with an Estes ready-to-fly kit and seek advice from fellow rocketeers at the National Association of Rocketry Facebook Group and the Rocketry Subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’ve got some experience, I hope you’ll give it a try! I’ve even shared a scale model of the Rocket Lab Electron you can build using my tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THRUST VECTOR CONTROL –&lt;/strong&gt; Ready to Aim Fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model rockets have fins and launch quickly, but real space launch vehicles don’t; they actively aim — vector — their rocket exhaust to steer the rocket. With thrust vectoring, your model rockets can slowly ascend and build speed like the real thing, instead of leaving your sight in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE COMPUTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Signal R2 flight computer runs a high-speed control loop, prioritizing functions depending on the progress of the flight. Thrust vectoring draws considerable current, so once burnout is detected, Signal centers and locks the vectoring mount. Focus is then set on detecting apogee and triggering pyro events. It needs at least 8V; 9V alkalines or 11.1V LiPos recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE TVC MOUNT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed over three years of iterative design, the thrust vector control motor mount is made from 3D printed PLA material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses two 9g servos, geared down for higher accuracy. The assembly can gimbal a motor ±5 degrees on each axis, X and Y. Though the mount will work with up to 40N of force, it works best with lower impulse motors, especially those with long burn times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SOFTWARE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight software tracks vehicle flight dynamics while the rocket is powered on. Signal looks for cues to shift system states at liftoff, burnout, apogee, and landing. This makes operation simple — once the settings file is configured for flight, just turn on the flight computer and it automatically enters Pad-idle mode. Signal can detect launch in under 10ms. Once detected, thrust vectoring is activated, in-flight abort is armed, and high-frequency data logging begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE DATA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-flight data logging takes place at 40Hz. Vectoring output, vehicle orientation, altitude, velocity, acceleration, and several other data points are recorded using a custom protocol to a high-speed flash chip. Upon landing detection, Signal creates a new CSV file on the microSD card, dumping flight data into it. Once the data is verified to match, the flash chip is cleared and Signal is ready to fly again. A 1GB card can store hundreds of flights. Flight settings are programmable in a settings file on the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signal is configured using an app on an iOS or Android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROPULSIVE VERTICAL LANDING&lt;/strong&gt; – Drop It While It’s Hot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started building my Signal TVC kits in spring 2017, I put my propulsive landing project on hold. This past year I got back to it: I started drop-testing my experimental Echo rocket from a drone and began a new YouTube series, “Landing Model Rockets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series explains my entire process, from selecting motors, to planning the flight profile, to developing a new control board for propulsive landing. It comes in two flavors: Blip, a DIY version using breakout boards and through-hole components; and Blop, a lighter, surface-mount PCB. Both are based on the powerful MK20DX256VLH7 processor that’s used in the Teensy 3.2 microcontroller, with a Bosch BMP280 barometric pressure sensor and InvenSense MPU-6050 inertial measurement unit (IMU). For now I’m sharing these experimental boards with my Patreon supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can you land with solid rocket motors if you can’t throttle them? It’s all about timing! If the flight profile is fairly well known and the legs are built to withstand small hops and drops, the motor can be fired at just the right time to slow the vehicle down for a soft landing. As the rocket nears the ground, the microcontroller reads the barometric altimeter and fires the retro motor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out vertical landing is super hard! As the rocket slows to a near-hover, horizontal drift becomes an issue. I’m already deep in the weeds programming the math necessary to control for this. I’m also experimenting with a tiny LIDAR sensor for really precise rangefinding to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several very near misses (watch them on YouTube), I refuse to not stick the landing in 2019! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/joebarnard&quot;&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUR ROCKET MOTOR QUESTIONS ANSWERED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Do you make your own motors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Nope, I use commercially available propellants. Usually black powder motors from Estes or APCP motors from Aerotech. For custom or more complicated builds, BPS.space outsources propellant work to other manufacturers, who can achieve higher precision and predictability. I learn best by experimentation, which works very well for software and electronics, less so for explosives and propellants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a C+ in chemistry during high school — designing and making rocket propellant is not a good idea for me. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I want to make my own rocket motors. Do you have any advice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: I strongly recommend against building your own rocket motors unless you have an experienced mentor or teacher to help you. There’s certainly information about building these motors online, but much of it is incorrect or lacks enough consideration for safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I heard that active control in model rockets is illegal, can’t you get in trouble for that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Nope, it’s not — active control has been around in model rocketry since the 1980s! None of the U.S. regulations prohibit active stability in model rockets. There’s an important distinction here between guidance and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidance is usually about maneuvering in reference to one or more real points in space. This might be via GPS, GLONASS, RF, or even dead reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stability is just about keeping the rocket upright, which serves the same purpose as fins on a traditional model rocket. Signal does not carry any GPS or point-based guidance equipment. The computer is only able to keep the rocket vertically stable off the launch pad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, I set out to build a 1/48 scale model of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket as a technology demonstrator for BPS.space, to showcase the advancement that’s now possible at the model scale. As usual, I underestimated it as a four-month job! I finally launched it in November of last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the three cores carries a flight computer, parachute deployment system, and TVC assembly. The upper stage flies with thrust vector control as well, and it carries a 3D-printed sports car — no Falcon Heavy model would be complete without one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-547284&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;An early CAD render of the vehicle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AVIONICS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Falcon Heavy flight computers are upgraded versions of Signal (see page 32). Each computer has MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers for sensing movement and orientation on the rocket, the same kind of sensors found in most smartphones. A barometric pressure sensor determines the rocket’s altitude above the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On each flight computer, a 48MHz Cortex M0 processor reads the flight sensors at 400Hz and logs 31 channels of data to a flash chip, 40 times per second. Every second that Falcon Heavy is in the air, 4,960 points of data are recorded onboard — never too much data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight computers don’t communicate with each other during flight; the sensors and software are accurate enough that it’s not required for short flights. None of the flight settings are hard-coded; depending on the flight profile, they can all be changed using the Signal iOS/Android app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight software is written in C++, the iOS app in Swift, and the Android app in Java. Flight guidance is computed using quaternions, a complex number system for 3D orientation and rotation that’s more computationally efficient than other methods (see youtu.be/d4EgbgTm0Bg for a wonderful introduction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MECHANICS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attachment points at the top of each side core slide down a ramp on the center core, giving them a bit of clearance during stage separation. This passive setup keeps things very simple during flight, but the cores are usually bolted together while the vehicle is on the ground. All three cores are also connected at the base of the vehicle using a slightly simpler thrust plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side cores remain attached to the vehicle by maintaining a slightly higher net thrust force than the center core/upper stage. As soon as the center core produces more net thrust than the side cores, it will pull away and the stages will separate. For flexibility, each side core also has a slot for a small separation motor; I haven’t needed to use sep motors on flights so far, but they may be helpful later down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center core of the Falcon Heavy model goes through two boost phases during flight. During the first phase, the side cores are attached. Right around side core burnout,&lt;br/&gt;the center core lights a second motor, and&lt;br/&gt;the second boost phase begins. These two rocket motors are mounted on top of each other in the center core’s thrust vectoring mount. When the second motor ignites, the lower, spent motor, is ejected. This same technique, called hot staging, is used to control ascent and propulsive landing motors in other BPS.space rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rocket motors in each stage of the Falcon Heavy model can be gimbaled ±5 degrees in any direction. Because the side cores are not firing directly through the vehicle’s center of mass, they can be used not just for pitch and yaw, but roll control as well. Each multi-core flight runs a roll program which usually targets 20 degrees of positive roll, executed at 30–40 degrees per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launching the Falcon Heavy model requires a bit of forethought. The center core motor has a slight thrust spike at ignition, after which the amount of force produced slowly tapers off. At liftoff, the side cores must have a greater net thrust than the center core. Because of this, the center core is lit at T–1 second while the vehicle is still held on the pad by the launch clamps. At T–0 the side cores are lit, and at T+0.25 the beast is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, do I even have to say it? Of course those boosters are gonna land! The propulsive landing test program is isolated from the Falcon Heavy program right now, but the two will merge as the success rate for both programs increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAUNCH PAD 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five iterations, Launch Pad 2.0 was redesigned from the ground up to support both single- and three-core rockets. With 8 total launch clamps, and an easily modifiable iron flame trench, Pad 2.0 is my most flexible platform yet. My Impulse launch computer, based on an Atmel ATSAMD21 microcontroller, has plenty of inputs and outputs to support add-ons like load cells, wireless communications, and any other peripheral that communicates through I2C or SPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;» Fine-tuning the TVC — I continue to launch the Signal R2 board on my new Scout D1 rocket to improve the tuning feature in the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;» Slow-burning propellant — Most model rocket motors burn just 3–7 seconds, not long enough to simulate real space vehicle launches. I’ve been working with Aerotech to develop long-burning motors such as their new G11 and G8ST that burns for almost 18 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;» High-powered rockets — I’ve been getting involved in the HPR community, where amateur rocket flights go miles high and safety is a lot more important. So I’m now developing the Arc dual deploy board: 2 pyro channels for firing main and drogue chutes, barometric altimeter up to 100,000 feet, multi-speed data logging, and Bluetooth for smartphone configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;» Reaction control system (RCS) — One more thing: Rather than attempt TVC on high-power motors, I’m developing a reaction control system — six little cold-gas thrusters near the top of the rocket to improve stability&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Plants “panic” when it rains</title>
<link>https://phys.org/news/2019-10-panic.html</link>

&lt;div data-thumb=&quot;https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2018/plant.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2018/plant.jpg&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;Credit: CC0 Public Domain&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2018/plant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;plant&quot; title=&quot;Credit: CC0 Public Domain&quot;/&gt; Credit: CC0 Public Domain&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team of scientists involving The University of Western Australia's School of Molecular Sciences, the ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology and Lund University has made the surprising discovery that a plant's reaction to rain is close to one of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;article-banner first-banner&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, revealed complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/chemical+signals/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;chemical signals&lt;/a&gt; are triggered when &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/water/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; lands on a plant to help it prepare for the dangers of rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UWA Professor Harvey Millar said after spraying plants with water and observing the effect, the researchers noticed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/chain+reaction/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;chain reaction&lt;/a&gt; in the plant caused by a protein called Myc2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When Myc2 is activated, thousands of genes spring into action preparing the plant's defences,&quot; Professor Millar said. &quot;These warning signals travel from leaf to leaf and induce a range of protective effects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As to why plants would need to panic when it rains, strange as it sounds, rain is actually the leading cause of disease spreading between plants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When a raindrop splashes across a leaf, tiny droplets of water ricochet in all directions. These droplets can contain bacteria, viruses, or fungal spores. A single droplet can spread these up to 10 metres to surrounding plants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence also suggests that when it rains, the same signals spreading across leaves are transmitted to nearby plants through the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the chemicals produced is a hormone called &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/jasmonic+acid/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;jasmonic acid&lt;/a&gt; that is used to send signals between plants,&quot; Professor Millar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If a plant's neighbours have their defence mechanisms turned on, they are less likely to spread disease, so it's in their best interest for plants to spread the warning to nearby plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When danger occurs, plants are not able to move out of the way so instead they rely on complex signalling systems to protect themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Millar said it was clear &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/plants/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; had an intriguing relationship with water, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/rain/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; a major carrier of disease but also vital for a plant's survival.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Grandmaster level in StarCraft II using multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
<link>https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;dm-section user-content&quot; readability=&quot;69.827131555816&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;AlphaStar is the first AI to reach the top league of a widely popular esport without any game restrictions.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This January&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a preliminary version of AlphaStar challenged two of the world's top players in StarCraft II, one of the most enduring and popular real-time strategy video games of all time. Since then, we have taken on a much greater challenge:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;playing the full game at a Grandmaster level under professionally approved conditions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our new research differs from prior work in several key regards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;AlphaStar now has the same kind of constraints that humans play under – including viewing the world through a camera, and stronger limits on the frequency of its actions* (in collaboration with StarCraft professional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LiquidTLO?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dario&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;span&gt;TLO”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LiquidTLO?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wünsch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;AlphaStar can now play in one-on-one matches as and against Protoss, Terran, and Zerg – the three races present in StarCraft II. Each of the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg agents is a single neural network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The League training is fully automated, and starts only with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;agents trained by supervised learning, rather than from previously trained agents from past experiments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/starcraft2/22933138/deepmind-research-on-ladder&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;AlphaStar played&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the official game server,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/?ref=battle.net&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Battle.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, using the same maps and conditions as human players. All game replays are available&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/alphastar-resources&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We chose to use general-purpose machine learning techniques – including neural networks, self-play via reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, and imitation learning – to learn directly from game data with general purpose techniques. Using the advances described in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://rdcu.be/bVI7G&quot;&gt;Nature paper&lt;/a&gt;, AlphaStar was ranked above 99.8% of active players on Battle.net, and achieved a Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft II races: Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. We expect these methods could be applied to many other domains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learning-based systems and self-play are elegant research concepts which have facilitated remarkable advances in artificial intelligence. In 1992, researchers at IBM developed TD-Gammon, combining a learning-based system with a neural network to play the game of backgammon. Instead of playing according to hard-coded rules or heuristics, TD-Gammon was designed to use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;to figure out, through trial-and-error, how to play the game in a way that maximises its probability of winning. Its developers used the notion of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;self-play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;to make the system more robust: by playing against versions of itself, the system grew increasingly proficient at the game. When combined, the notions of learning-based systems and self-play provide a powerful paradigm of open-ended learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many advances since then have demonstrated that these approaches can be scaled to progressively challenging domains. For example, AlphaGo and AlphaZero established that it was possible for a system to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;learn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;to achieve superhuman performance at Go, chess, and shogi, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI Five&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/article/capture-the-flag-science&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeepMind’s FTW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;demonstrated the power of self-play in the modern games of Dota 2 and Quake III. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At DeepMind, we’re interested in understanding the potential – and limitations – of open-ended learning, which enables us to develop robust and flexible agents that can cope with complex, real-world domains. Games like StarCraft are an excellent training ground to advance these approaches, as players must use limited information to make dynamic and difficult decisions that have ramifications on multiple levels and timescales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;dm-h4 ng-tns-c40-1 ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;I’ve found AlphaStar’s gameplay incredibly impressive – the system is very skilled at assessing its strategic position, and knows exactly when to engage or disengage with its opponent. And while AlphaStar has excellent and precise control, it doesn’t feel superhuman – certainly not on a level that a human couldn’t theoretically achieve. Overall, it feels very fair – like it is playing a ‘real’ game of StarCraft.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite its successes, self-play suffers from well known drawbacks. The most salient one is forgetting: an agent playing against itself may keep improving, but it also may forget how to win against a previous version of itself. Forgetting can create a cycle of an agent “chasing its tail”, and never converging or making real progress. For example, in the game rock-paper-scissors, an agent may currently prefer to play rock over other options. As self-play progresses, a new agent will then choose to switch to paper, as it wins against rock. Later, the agent will switch to scissors, and eventually back to rock, creating a cycle. Fictitious self-play - playing against a mixture of all previous strategies - is one solution to cope with this challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/announcements/deepmind-and-blizzard-open-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;open-sourcing StarCraft II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;as a research environment, we found that even fictitious self-play techniques were insufficient to produce strong agents, so we set out to develop a better, general-purpose solution. A central idea of our recently published Nature paper extends the notion of fictitious self-play to a group of agents – the League. Normally in self-play, every agent maximises its probability of winning against its opponents; however, this was only part of the solution. In the real world, a player trying to improve at StarCraft may choose to do so by partnering with friends so that they can train particular strategies. As such, their training partners are not playing to win against every possible opponent, but are instead exposing the flaws of their friend, to help them become a better and more robust player. The key insight of the League is that playing to win is insufficient: instead, we need both main agents whose goal is to win versus everyone, and also exploiter agents that focus on helping the main agent grow stronger by exposing its flaws, rather than maximising their own win rate against all players. Using this training method, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;League learns all its complex StarCraft II strategy in an end-to-end, fully automated fashion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Figure 1 depicts some of the challenges in complex domains such as StarCraft. (Top row) Players can create a variety of ‘units’ (e.g. workers, fighters, or transporters) to deploy in different strategic moves. Units have balanced strengths and weaknesses in a manner analogous to the game rock-paper-scissors. Thanks to imitation learning, our initial agent can already execute a diverse set of strategies, depicted here as a composition of units created in the game (in this example: Void rays, Stalkers and Immortals). However, because some strategies are easier to improve on, naive reinforcement learning would narrowly focus on these. Other strategies may require more learning, or have particular nuances that make them harder for the agent to perfect. This creates a vicious cycle in which some valid strategies appear less and less effective because the agent abandons them in favour of a dominant strategy. (Bottom row) We added agents to the League whose sole purpose is to expose weaknesses of the main agent. This means that more valid strategies will be discovered and developed, making the main agent far more robust against their opponents. At the same time, we employed imitation learning techniques (including distillation) to prevent AlphaStar from forgetting throughout training, and by using latent variables to represent a diverse set of opening moves.&quot; srcset=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TU-D3tpNn0neBxYv1mdyF6colPJOe8yqmFuK3_ltTusdqbtfluZV97KV8-UmYA22zh480z0Ndrup_HpJc2Pr736wm-WMVVenngdIdA=w2048 2x&quot; src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TU-D3tpNn0neBxYv1mdyF6colPJOe8yqmFuK3_ltTusdqbtfluZV97KV8-UmYA22zh480z0Ndrup_HpJc2Pr736wm-WMVVenngdIdA=w1440&quot;/&gt; Figure 1 depicts some of the challenges in complex domains such as StarCraft.

&lt;div class=&quot;dm-section user-content&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exploration is another key challenge in complex environments such as StarCraft. There are up to 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; possible actions available to one of our agents at each time step, and the agent must make thousands of actions before learning if it has won or lost the game. Finding winning strategies is challenging in such a massive solution space. Even with a strong self-play system and a diverse league of main and exploiter agents, there would be almost no chance of a system developing successful strategies in such a complex environment without some prior knowledge. Learning human strategies, and ensuring that the agents keep exploring those strategies throughout self-play, was key to unlocking AlphaStar’s performance. To do this, we used imitation learning – combined with advanced neural network architectures and techniques used for language modelling – to create an initial policy which played the game better than 84% of active players. We also used a latent variable which conditions the policy and encodes the distribution of opening moves from human games, which helped to preserve high-level strategies. AlphaStar then used a form of distillation throughout self-play to bias exploration towards human strategies. This approach enabled AlphaStar to represent many strategies within a single neural network (one for each race). During evaluation, the neural network was not conditioned on any specific opening moves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;dm-h4 ng-tns-c40-3 ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;AlphaStar is an intriguing and unorthodox player – one with the reflexes and speed of the best pros but strategies and a style that are entirely its own. The way AlphaStar was trained, with agents competing against each other in a league, has resulted in gameplay that’s unimaginably unusual; it really makes you question how much of StarCraft’s diverse possibilities pro players have really explored.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dm-section user-content&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, we found that many prior approaches to reinforcement learning are ineffective in StarCraft, due to its enormous action space. In particular, AlphaStar uses a new algorithm for off-policy reinforcement learning, which allows it to efficiently update its policy from games played by an older policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open-ended learning systems that utilise learning-based agents and self-play have achieved impressive results in increasingly challenging domains. Thanks to advances in imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and the League, we were able to train AlphaStar Final, an agent that reached Grandmaster level at the full game of StarCraft II without any modifications, as shown in the above video. This agent played online anonymously, using the gaming platform Battle.net, and achieved a Grandmaster level using all three StarCraft II races. AlphaStar played using a camera interface, with similar information to what human players would have, and with restrictions on its action rate to make it comparable with human players. The interface and restrictions were approved by a professional player. Ultimately, these results provide strong evidence that general-purpose learning techniques can scale AI systems to work in complex, dynamic environments involving multiple actors. The techniques we used to develop AlphaStar will help further the safety and robustness of AI systems in general, and, we hope, may serve to advance our research in real-world domains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;dm-h4 ng-tns-c40-5 ng-star-inserted&quot;&gt;It was exciting to see the agent develop its own strategies differently from the human players [...]. The caps on the actions it can take and the camera view restrictions now make for compelling games – even though, as a pro, I can still spot some of the system’s weaknesses.&lt;/h4&gt;
