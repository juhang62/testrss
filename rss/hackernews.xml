&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Up to 1 million plant and animal species are on the verge of extinction, with alarming implications for human survival, according to a United Nations report released Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The report’s findings underscore the conclusions of previous scientific studies that say human activity is wreaking havoc on the wild kingdom, threatening the existence of living things ranging from giant whales to small flowers and insects that are almost impossible to see with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;But the global report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services goes a step further than previous studies by linking the loss of species to humans and analyzing its effect on food and water security, farming and economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/ipbes-global-report-species-extinction-rate-is-accelerating/f724e478-da85-4e89-83f9-f663c496f08c/?utm_term=.6c6230b31315&quot;&gt;Read the U.N. global report: Species extinction rate is accelerating&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;According to the report, more plants and animals are threatened with extinction now than any other period in human history. Nature’s current rate of decline is unparalleled, it says, and the accelerating rate of extinctions “means grave impacts on people around the world are now likely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;In a prepared statement, Robert Watson, a British chemist who served as the panel’s chairman, said the decline in biodiversity is eroding “the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Cslkz5UQEdoClXD5Xkhg_gqV3vc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TNYE5KTGBEI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SBSo78PaEmcgEMHz45y3vz_3e1I=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TNYE5KTGBEI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TNYE5KTGBEI6TJUYFKHYBDE47M.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Moe Flannery of the California Academy of Sciences inspected a dead gray whale in Tiburon, Calif., last month, one of seven whales that have washed up on the shores of the San Francisco Bay and along the coast in recent weeks. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;The report’s authors declared that the world’s governments should address the global decline of biodiversity together with human-caused climate change. The warming climate is a major driver that is exacerbating the effects of overfishing, widespread pesticide use, pollution and urban expansion into the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;For example, ocean ecosystems are degrading as temperatures rise toward 2 degrees Celsius — 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit — above preindustrial levels, the study warns. Coral reefs lost to warming and acidifying oceans could cause a collapse in commercial and indigenous fisheries, affecting billions of coastal residents who rely on seafood for protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;“Once you get to basically 2 degrees Celsius, the models show that only 1 percent can survive,” Watson said. “Let’s be quite candid. We’re not on the pathway to 2 degrees Celsius. We’re on a pathway to 3, 3 ½ degrees Celsius. The coral system is truly in trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;The report emphasized the effects humans have an animals that are key to their own survival. Pesticides sprayed by farmers kill pollinators such as bees and other insects will likely to have a devastating effect on crops. Homeowners contribute to the problem by purchasing “bug zappers” that target mosquitoes but also eliminate key pollinators such as butterflies and moths, as well as common flies that some animals rely on for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Global trade has introduced invasive species to countries with devastating effects, such as crop-destroying stink bugs and tree-killing emerald ash borer in the United States. Travelers exploring forests in other countries have returned home with microbes that cause diseases lethal to animals, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/03/23/a-merciless-bat-killing-fungus-is-on-the-move-again-now-its-in-texas/?utm_term=.0f6d2824bad7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;white nose fungus&lt;/a&gt; that is killing millions of bats whose immune systems have not adapted to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;“The most important thing isn’t necessarily that we’re losing . . . 1 million species — although that’s important, don’t misunderstand me,” Watson said during a teleconference Sunday. “The bigger issue is the way it will affect human well-being, as we’ve said many times — food, water, energy, human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;“We care about nature, but we care about human well-being,” Watson said. “We need to link it to human well-being; that’s the crucial thing. Otherwise we’re going to look like a bunch of tree-huggers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;The report has a positive spin, saying that “it is not too late to make a difference.” But that difference requires more than 100 developing and nondeveloped nations to work together to bring about change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Nations that signed off on the study’s findings acknowledged that opposition from rich people invested in the status quo is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;“Since 1992, we’ve been telling the world we have a problem,” Watson said. “Now what’s different? It’s much worse today than it was in 1992. We’ve wasted all of the time . . . the last 25 years.” However, he said, “we have a much better understanding of the links between climate change, biodiversity, and food security and water security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;Nearly 150 authors from 50 nations worked for three years to compile the report. They relied on input from 300 contributing authors who assessed the impact of economic development on nature to estimate future effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;They noted that the world’s population has doubled since 1950 and that urban areas worldwide have doubled since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;The resulting pressure on natural resources has been enormous. Seventy-five percent of the land environment and well more than half the marine environment have been altered by humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;On land, “more than a third of the world’s land surface and nearly 75 percent of freshwater resources are now devoted to crop or livestock production,” the report says. Farms that cut into forests that trap carbon have expanded exponentially, increasing crop production by 300 percent since 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;At sea, a third of marine fish stocks were being harvested at unsustainable levels in 2015. “Sixty percent were maximally sustainably fished,” meaning they were being pushed to the verge of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AL54Gl_Yrzr4jFgo9WPruV4ajE4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FHLFA5CAKEI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RztV3575MvW6RlrAWysHMulc9-c=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FHLFA5CAKEI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FHLFA5CAKEI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Onlookers stand before paper mache replicas of the critically endangered porpoise known as the vaquita during an event in front of the Mexico’s National Palace in Mexico City. (Rebecca Blackwell/AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Humans extract 60 billion tons from nature each year to satisfy demands worldwide for crops, fish, minerals and other goods, the authors said. They concluded that the harvest is unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;The U.N. report followed a study in January that predicted a bug massacre — 40 percent of all known species face extinction, including beetles, flies, moths, butterflies and bees, the result of habitat loss and pesticides, according to a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;The United States is hardly immune to the loss of biodiversity. In recent weeks, the federal government moved to protect a declining group of Bryde’s whales in the Gulf of Mexico with an endangered listing because fewer than 100, and possibly as few as 45, are estimated to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;In January, wild reindeer were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/03/22/americas-reindeer-have-quietly-gone-extinct-lower/?utm_term=.ad0d4fb4d1bc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;declared extinct&lt;/a&gt; in the Lower 48 states. Wildlife managers in British Columbia caught the last female in a herd of caribou that once migrated between the Pacific Northwest and Canada and stuck her in a pen because “that animal was not going to survive,” an official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, a doomsday count on the tiny &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2016/09/30/the-world-is-making-a-last-push-to-save-its-cutest-porpoise-from-extinction-it-probably-wont-work/?utm_term=.430ddbf35671&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vaquita porpoise&lt;/a&gt; in the Gulf of California is nearing zero. As Mexican fisherman continue to poach shrimp and fish consumed in the United States, vaquitas occasionally show up dead in their fishing nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;In Antarctica, the second-largest group of emperor penguins, the tallest of all penguins, has not produced offspring for three years, assuring a catastrophic drop in their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;The U.N. report “means that nature is collapsing around us, and it’s a real wake-up call to humanity,” said Andrew Wetzler, managing director of the nature program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a conservation group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;Oceana senior adviser Philip Chou called the report a beacon for more action to address a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;“We are seeing alarming increases in the deaths of fish, marine mammals and turtles ingesting plastics,” Chou said. “These plastics break apart in the ocean into microscopic particles [that are] consumed by fish, fish we now eat.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>&amp;#039;One Ring&amp;#039; Phone Scam</title>
<link>https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/one-ring-phone-scam</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/one-ring-phone-scam</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For illegal robocallers, the goal isn't always getting you to answer. Sometimes, it's getting you to call back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every so often, your phone may ring once and then stop. If that happens to you, and you do not recognize the number, do not return the call. You may be the target of a &quot;one-ring&quot; phone scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-ring calls may appear to be from phone numbers somewhere in the United States, including three initial digits that resemble U.S. area codes. But savvy scammers often use international numbers from regions that also begin with three-digit codes – for example, &quot;649&quot; goes to the Turks and Caicos and &quot;809&quot; goes to the Dominican Republic. Such scammers may often use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/spoofing&quot;&gt;spoofing&lt;/a&gt; techniques, as well, to further mask the number in your caller ID display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you call any such number, you risk being connected to a phone number outside the U.S. As a result, you may wind up being charged a fee for connecting, along with significant per-minute fees for as long as they can keep you on the phone. These charges may show up on your bill as premium services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations of this scam rely on phony voice-mail messages urging you to call a number with an unfamiliar area code to &quot;collect a prize&quot; or to notify you about a &quot;sick&quot; relative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to avoid this scam&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't answer or return any calls from numbers you don't recognize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before calling unfamiliar numbers, check to see if the area code is international.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do not make international calls, ask your phone company to block outgoing international calls on your line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always be cautious, even if a number appears authentic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Filing a complaint with the FCC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are billed for a call you made as a result of this scam, first try to resolve the matter with your telephone company. If you are unable to resolve it directly, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/&quot;&gt;file a complaint with the FCC&lt;/a&gt; at not cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel that you are a victim of an international phone scam, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov&quot;&gt;file a complaint with the FTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Print Out&lt;/h4&gt;

<og:title>'One Ring' Phone Scam</og:title>
<og:description>The FCC has learned of a phone scam targeting wireless consumers. Some wireless consumers receive calls from phone numbers with three-digit area codes that appear to be domestic, but are actually associated with international pay-per-call phone numbers. These calls often disconnect after one ring, not giving the consumer time to answer the call and tempting them to return the call. If you receive a call like this and do not recognize the number of the incoming call, do not return the call. If you return the phone call, you may be connected to an international hotline than can charge a fee just for connecting, along with significant per-minute fees if they can keep you on the phone. These charges may show up on your bill as premium services. This scam appears to be a variation of an old long distance phone scam that tricks consumers into receiving high charges on their phone bills. In the past, telephone consumers have been fooled into making expensive international calls by scam artists who leave messages on consumers' answering machines or their email accounts. The messages urge consumers to call a number with an &quot;809,&quot; &quot;284,&quot; &quot;876&quot; or some other area code to collect a prize, find out about a sick relative, or engage in sex talk.</og:description>

<title>Boeing Believed a 737 Max Warning Light Was Standard</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/business/boeing-737-max-warning-light.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/business/boeing-737-max-warning-light.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Boeing began delivering its 737 Max to customers in 2017, the company believed that a key cockpit warning light was a standard feature in all of the new jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But months after the planes were flying, company engineers realized that the warning light worked only on planes whose customers had bought a different, optional indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In essence, that meant a safety feature that Boeing thought was standard was actually a premium add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing detailed its initial confusion about the warning light in &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130431&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; released on Sunday, adding new details to what was already known about the flawed design and introduction of the 737 Max, its best-selling jetliner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The initial lack of knowledge about the feature’s functionality, along with the delayed disclosure, add to the concern about Boeing’s management of the Max’s design. The revelations add to Boeing’s mounting problems, which include frayed relations with airlines and customers, multiple federal investigations, growing financial costs and the remaining work to get the Max flying again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The warning light notifies pilots of a disagreement in the sensors that measure which direction the plane is pointed, a potential sign of a malfunction. This light could have provided critical information to the pilots on two flights that crashed shortly after takeoff in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In both doomed flights — Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 — preliminary investigations suggest that there were problems with these so-called angle of attack sensors early in the flights, activating new anti-stall software that sent the planes into unrecoverable nose-dives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the disagree alert worked only on planes with an optional indicator that displays the readings from the angle of attack sensors, Boeing said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Because only 20 percent of customers had purchased the optional indicator, the warning light was not working on most of Boeing’s new jets. Neither Lion Air nor Ethiopian had the indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After discovering the lapse in 2017, Boeing performed an internal review and determined that the lack of a working warning light “did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation,” it said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As a result, Boeing said it did not inform airlines or the Federal Aviation Administration about the mistake for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Only after the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 last October did Boeing discuss the matter with the F.A.A. The company then conducted another review and again found the missing alert did not pose a safety threat, and told the F.A.A. as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing and the F.A.A. put out public updates late last year that described the warning light as available only if the optional indicator had been purchased as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But neither statement made it clear that Boeing had intended for the disagree alert to be standard in all planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sngw6j&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1eoytci&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/us/lion-air-crash-cockpit-promo-1542393182522/lion-air-crash-cockpit-promo-1542393182522-articleLarge.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1rha1bf&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-zd32qr&quot;&gt;What the Lion Air Pilots May Have Needed to Do to Avoid a Crash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1uuihdo&quot;&gt;The rapid series of steps that may have been needed to save the plane were not in the manual, and the pilots had not been trained on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. said on Sunday that Boeing briefed it on the confusion in November, and that it deemed the issue to be “low risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“However, Boeing’s timely or earlier communication with the operators would have helped to reduce or eliminate possible confusion,” the F.A.A. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The anti-stall system, created to compensate for the Max’s large new engines, will push down the nose of the plane if the angle of attack sensors indicate the plane is dangerously close to stalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the system relied on only one of the two angle of attack sensors, introducing a potential single point of failure into a critical flight system. And the anti-stall system was also changed late in the design process to make it much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Airlines and pilots were not informed about the system until the Lion Air crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Boeing explained to pilots in one meeting how systems on the Max worked, the company said that the disagree alert would function on the ground. In the late November meeting, Boeing told pilots for American Airlines (which had bought the add-on) that their disagree alert would have notified them of problems before takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We were told that if the A.O.A. vane, like on Lion Air, was in a massive difference, we would receive an alert on the ground and therefore not even take off,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the union representing American Airlines pilots. “That gave us additional confidence in continuing to fly that aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But in the last several weeks, Boeing has been saying something different. Mr. Tajer said the company recently told American pilots that the system would not alert pilots about any sensor disagreement until the aircraft is 400 feet above the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sngw6j&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1eoytci&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/business/boeing-737-max-8-flaws-1553903212386/boeing-737-max-8-flaws-1553903212386-articleLarge.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1rha1bf&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-zd32qr&quot;&gt;The Dangerous Flaws in Boeing’s Automated System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1uuihdo&quot;&gt;Here’s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A Boeing spokesman confirmed this, stressing that the disagree alert does not work on the ground, and thus could not have alerted the Lion Air pilots to a faulty sensor before takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Tajer said Boeing seemed to have “provided information that was not accurate” and said the pilots have asked for clarification from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Tajer, who is also a 737 pilot, said he was concerned that Boeing did not seem to fully grasp how every aspect of the Max worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You better start knowing things about the airplane you’re building and selling because my life and the passengers that I carry safely across the globe depends on it,” Mr. Tajer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Lion Air crash also spurred Boeing to notify Southwest pilots about the disagree light. “We thought it worked,” said Jon Weaks, the president of the Southwest Pilots’ Association. “If they knew it in 2017, why did we get to nearly the end of 2018 until the manual was changed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the months after the Lion Air crash, Boeing quietly worked to appease some customers, according to a person briefed on the matter. In several instances, it activated the angle of attack indicator for free, which then turned on the disagree alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The 737 Max has been grounded for more than a month, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing is working on a software fix that it plans to submit to the F.A.A. soon, in hopes that the Max can return to flight later this summer. The update will make the anti-stall system less powerful and reliant on both sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing is also developing a separate software update that will unlink the disagree alert from the angle of attack indicators, which will also be installed before the Max can fly again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Canada Border Services seizes lawyer&amp;#039;s phone, laptop for not sharing passwords</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cbsa-boarder-security-search-phone-travellers-openmedia-1.5119017</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cbsa-boarder-security-search-phone-travellers-openmedia-1.5119017</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As more people travel with smartphones loaded with personal data, concern is mounting over Canadian border officers' powers to search those phones — without a warrant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The policy's outrageous,&quot; said Toronto business lawyer, Nick Wright. &quot;I think that it's a breach of our constitutional rights.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His thoughts follow a personal experience. After landing at Toronto's Pearson Airport on April 10, he said the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) flagged him for an additional inspection — for no stated reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wright had just returned from a four-month trip to Guatemala and Colombia where he studied Spanish and worked remotely. He took no issue when a border services officer searched his bags, but drew the line when the officer demanded his passwords to also search his phone and laptop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wright refused, telling the officer both devices contained confidential information protected by solicitor-client privilege.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said the officer then confiscated his phone and laptop, and told him the items would be sent to a government lab which would try to crack his passwords and search his files.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5122107.1557086810!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/nick-wright-nicks-rocche-chavajay-in-san-pedro-la-laguna-guatemala.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Nick Wright poses with his Spanish instructor, Nicks Rocche Chavajay, in San Pedro La Laguna, Guatemala.  (submitted by Nick Wright)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my view, seizing devices when someone exercises their constitutional right is an affront to civil liberty,&quot; said Wright who's still waiting for the return of his phone and laptop. Meanwhile, he said he has spent about $3,000 to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officers can search your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CBSA-FOI-Docs.pdf&quot;&gt;According to the CBSA&lt;/a&gt;, it has the right to search electronic devices at the border for evidence of customs-related offences — without a warrant — just as it does with luggage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If travellers refuse to provide their passwords, officers can seize their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBSA said that between November 2017 and March 2019, 19,515 travellers had their digital devices examined, which represents 0.015 per cent of all cross-border travellers during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 38 per cent of those searches, officers uncovered evidence of a customs-related offence — which can include possessing prohibited material or undeclared goods, and money laundering, said the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4311888.1556906736!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/canada-syria-migrants.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;According to the Canada Border Services Agency, its officers have the right to search any goods crossing the border without a warrant -- including electronic devices.  (Mark Blinch/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the laws governing CBSA searches have existed for decades, applying them to digital devices has sparked concern in an era where many travellers carry smartphones full of personal and sometimes very sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of lawyers across Canada argue that warrantless digital device searches at the border &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/lawyers-canada-warrantless-smartphone-searches-customs-act-1.4247036&quot;&gt;are unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;, and the practice should be stopped or at least limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The policy of the CBSA of searching devices isn't something that is justifiable in a free and democratic society,&quot; said Wright who ran as a Green Party candidate in the 2015 federal election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's appalling, it's shocking, and I hope that government, government agencies and the courts, and individual citizens will inform themselves and take action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Out of date' laws&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer advocacy group, OpenMedia is already taking action. It has launched an &lt;a href=&quot;https://borderprivacy.ca/?utm_source=nom&amp;amp;utm_medium=slideshow&amp;amp;utm_content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=7169&amp;amp;utm_term&amp;amp;tdid=2104&quot;&gt;online and ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; to raise awareness about digital border searches and pressure the federal government to update the rules that govern them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These laws are incredibly, incredibly out of date,&quot; said OpenMedia privacy campaigner Victoria Henry. &quot;The way they treat our digital devices are as mere goods and that's the same classification as a bag of T-shirts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to see separate border rules for digital devices which stipulate reasonable grounds for a search. Henry also said those rules must be clearly laid out to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to have clear and transparent policies and mechanisms for recourse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5122182.1556907917!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/openmedia-ad-border-phone-search.JPG&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;An example of an ad that OpenMedia plans to run, starting in June on the Vancouver Skytrain. (submitted by OpenMedia)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government says that its current policies are both reasonable and necessary to keep Canadian borders secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBSA officers are directed to disable any internet connection and only examine content that is already stored on a device, said Scott Bardsley, spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said that digital searches &quot;should not be routine&quot; and that &quot;officers may only conduct a search if there are multiple indicators that evidence of contraventions may be found on a device.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said, in his case, no rationale was provided why his phone and laptop needed to be examined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were no factors that I'm aware of that would justify the searches.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Respect for privacy'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Safety spokesperson Bardsley also said that CBSA officers understand the importance of solicitor-client privilege and are instructed not to examine documents that fall within that scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;CBSA officers are trained to conduct all border examinations with as much respect for privacy as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said that wasn't his experience. Instead, the officer he dealt with neither expressed knowledge of, nor responded to his concerns that his laptop and phone contained solicitor-client privileged documents, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;His response was only to demand the passwords to access both.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bardsley said that if travellers have issues or concerns, they can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/com-eng.html&quot;&gt;submit a complaint&lt;/a&gt; to the CBSA. He added that the government is investing $24 million to enhance oversight by creating an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/com-eng.html&quot;&gt;independent review body&lt;/a&gt; for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright has already submitted his complaint to the CBSA which includes a demand for the immediate return of his phone and laptop, plus compensation for having to temporarily replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If and when he gets them back, his battle may not be over; Wright is now considering legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it's important that we all stand up for our civil liberties and our charter rights,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch: What border officers can search on your phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Access Economy: Why the Normal Distribution Is Vanishing (2015)</title>
<link>https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: although I originally wrote this as a stand-alone post, it may make sense to think of it as Part Two of a series, beginning with &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexdanco.com/2015/02/02/the-rise-of-the-access-economy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Rise of the Access Economy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.500924214418&quot;&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-market-demand-curve-definition-equation-examples.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a classic exercise&lt;/a&gt; that we often encounter in business school, or elsewhere in higher education: the professor proposes, “I have two tickets to the Taylor Swift concert this Saturday night. All of you should write down on a piece of paper the maximum amount they’d be willing to pay for these tickets, then turn them in, and we’ll look at the distribution of those prices.” The idea is that from there, a promoter should be able to determine the optimal price (or sets of prices) to charge in order to maximize their sales.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;661&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/t_concert-2/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=700&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;600,313&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;t_concert&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=700?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=700?w=600&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-661 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=700&quot; alt=&quot;t_concert&quot; srcset=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png 600w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=150 150w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/t_concert1.png?w=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what typically happens is we see a distribution of numbers get passed in. Some are willing to pay lots, others not so much, and a bunch of people lie somewhere in the middle. We often see these numbers form something like a Gaussian distribution, or as it’s known to the general public, a ‘Normal Distribution’. Why do we see this distribution a lot? And why is it called ‘Normal’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Editor’s note: I play fast and loose here with what a ‘Normal’ distribution technically means here. If you’re mathematically inclined, kindly replace the words Normal and Gaussian with ‘Unscientific Lumpy Middle’ and the points should still hold just fine.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this distribution all over the place: in nature, in business, in life. If you’ve taken high school biology, you’ve probably encountered this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a good reason why the normal distribution pops up so much: it represents the sum of some number of component factors. If you’ve played the game Settlers of Catan, you’ll be very familiar with this phenomenon: the outcome of the total roll of the dice, which represents the sum of one die plus the other, follows an approximately normal distribution. If you were rolling five dice instead of two (like in Yahtzee), you’d see this distribution more clearly. If you’re dealing with hundreds or thousands of factors (like human genes), you see normal distributions arise for things like our height. Even when some of these factor are inter-dependent, as is certainly the case with our genetics, we still reliably encounter these distributions: whenever we encounter the sum of many factors, there they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should make sense that our stated prices for these Taylor Swift tickets should follow a distribution like this: you could think of it as a sum of many factors. How much did you like &lt;em&gt;1989&lt;/em&gt;? How much disposable income do you have? How far would you have to travel? What are your other options? Would you have friends who would go with you? And so forth. We can generalize this example to our preferences and choices generally: the decisions we make whenever we spend something (money, time, opportunity, etc) represent the sum of many factors. Suppose you’re shopping for a new car: the distribution of new car prices aren’t quite symmetrically Gaussian (there’s a long tail towards the high end), but it’s still Normal-ish. If you’re looking for a car as a young person, you’ll have a certain set of factors you consider – cost, value, practicality, style. As you grow up, these factors will change, but the decision will remain multifactorial in nature – many of your preferences will evolve, but along a similar set of variables. Some of us buy luxury cars, others buy the cheapest that they can, and most of us are in the big fat middle – like rolling two dice and landing somewhere between a 4 and a 10. It won’t happen every time, but it’ll happen most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s just one problem with this principle: it’s vanishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these three situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You’re looking to buy a new smartphone. What does your demand distribution look like? Is it normally distributed? Absolutely not. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are good that if you’re in the market for a smartphone, you fall into one of two very clear cut categories. Either: a. you’ve decided that your new phone is a very important item in your life, so you’re going to buy the nicest phone available at whatever price. (Usually this means an iPhone, although some flagship Android phones qualify for this category.) Or, b. you’ve decided that just about every phone out there is ‘good enough’ and is more than adequate for your needs, so you’ll go with whatever one costs $0 with your existing wireless contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. You have twenty minutes of free time to spend reading things on the internet. How will you choose to allocate your attention? Odds are, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;24.652777777778&quot;&gt;Chances are good that your next twenty minutes will fall into one of two categories. Either: a. you go to a very specific destination site that you had in mind, with content that you will not find anywhere else and that you know exactly where to find. This could be a high-end news source like the New York Times; it could also be a small, niche site like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stratechery.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt;. But either way they’re a destination site – you’ve chosen explicitly that they, and precisely they, are what you’re going to read. Or, b. you don’t choose anything at all; instead you had to Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc and just browse through whatever’s posted there. Often it’s content with broad, mass appeal like Buzzfeed or Vox that no one is looking for directly, but many are happy to click and read.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. You’re a recent college graduate trying to decide where you’ll live. How will you make this decision? Will your options and preferences be normally distributed? Probably not. Odds are, your decision looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;654&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/live_where_3/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1186,618&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;live_where_3&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=700&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-654&quot; src=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=481&amp;amp;h=250&quot; alt=&quot;live_where_3&quot; width=&quot;481&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; srcset=&quot;https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=481&amp;amp;h=250 481w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=960&amp;amp;h=500 960w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=150&amp;amp;h=78 150w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=156 300w, https://alexdanco.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/live_where_3.png?w=768&amp;amp;h=400 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are good that your decision will fall into one of two categories. Either: a. you’re trying to break into the film industry, so you’re overwhelmingly drawn towards LA. Or you’re trying to join a tech startup, so might be drawn to the Bay area. Or for any number of reasons. you just &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to live in New York. And you’re willing to put up with all kinds of horrible side effects in order to live in that exact right place. Or, b. You will move anywhere where you get a job, or get into grad school, or where your girlfriend is moving – it’s effectively a single-variable decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t normal distributions at all. They’re totally different – they’re bifurcated distributions where one factor is dominating over all of the other factors. Either you care about X, or you don’t. Either you care about Y, or you don’t. And what used to be the happy middle – the fat part of the normal distribution, where most of the demand is supposed to lie – is all of a sudden quite sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world seems to be steadily moving in this direction: from one where our demands and preferences are normally distributed to one dominated by these weird, bifurcated, two-tier balances. Why is this happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hunch is this: &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he world’s shift from Normal, Gaussian distributions of demand towards bifurcated, two-tiered distributions is a natural consequence of our shift from a world governed by scarcity to one governed by abundance. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world governed by scarcity – which is the one we’re used to thinking about, and the one described in our economics textbooks – it makes &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; sense for our purchasing and preferences to be multi-factor considerations with normally distributed outcomes. This is because when X is scarce, our default position towards X is ‘potentially interested, if the price / conditions are right’. We consider many factors when determining whether conditions are right, so our preferences and decisions are multifactorial in nature – that’s why we see normal distributions so consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a world governed by abundance, it’s all different. When X is abundantly available in many different places and forms, our default position towards any given X is ‘not interested’ unless something specific changes our minds. These aren’t multifactorial decisions – they’re usually dominated by one single factor whose influence trumps everything else. If you care about your smartphone, you’re going to get the nicest one; if you don’t, you’re going to get the cheap one. If you have something specific you want to read, you’re going to read exactly that; otherwise, you’re just going to scroll through Facebook and read whatever. If you care about living in New York, you’re probably ready to make a lot of concessions in order to live there; if you don’t, then there’s no chance. If you’re a Taylor Swift fan, you’re probably willing to pay a lot of money for those tickets; if you aren’t, then there’s a good chance you aren’t willing to pay &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; money for them because even if they were free, you’d rather do something else on Saturday night anyway. The normal distribution is disappearing: we’re in a new world where either you care about something, or you don’t. The middle ground is vanishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do with this idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do, in my view, is to look for areas of the world where our preferences are still normally distributed. Then ask: is this because we’re still operating on scarcity-based principles? And if so, are we headed down the road towards abundance-based principles? If so, what can we expect in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one example: personal banking. Our personal banking requirements are still being served by a big, fat, normally distributed group of companies and services. How come? Is it scarcity-based demand? Well, it certainly isn’t because of actual scarcity. With the birth of online banking and creative partnerships with distribution channels, it’s entirely possible to do your basic banking through any number of online, cheap and functional banking institutions – not to mention the multitude of brick and mortar branches that are all around us, competing for our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have genuinely complex banking and credit requirements. Others don’t. And in a world where banking services are abundant – which I believe we’ve entered, at least in the western world – I’m guessing we’re headed towards a similar iOS/Android style bifurcation. At the high end, we’ll see companies and services like American Express – the iOS of cards in my wallet. But what about the low end? Who’s issuing the basic, cheap, functional personal credit – the low-end Android?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now it’s other banks. But it doesn’t need to be. Banks are expensive to run (especially those with a big physical presence at brick and mortar branches); they’re built for the normally distributed world with its fat middle. But they’re not built for this new, bifurcated world – many of them can’t compete at the low end or the high end; they’re not sophisticated enough to compete with Chase and Amex, but too operationally expensive to compete with an online-only credit union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;17.914285714286&quot;&gt;Who could replace them? Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2014/10/21/will-wal-marts-new-checking-accounts-change-the-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;someone like Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, who already has customer loyalty, the ultimate physical channel, and the resources to make it work? Or maybe, in developing countries whose residents are still unbanked, the wireless carriers? Or maybe emerging payment companies like TenCent, or AliPay, could become effective creditors themselves?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;28.747606614447&quot;&gt;For another example, let’s return to our earlier anecdote about cars. Like I said, automobile production today isn’t a perfect normal distribution – it’s got a bit of a long tail towards the luxury end – but for the most part it’s Gaussian-like. But if we fast forward thirty years, we may see something very different. If the promise of Uber and the driverless car &lt;a href=&quot;http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/7/27/ways-to-think-about-cars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comes true&lt;/a&gt;, we could be living in a world where the majority of people do not own their vehicles; they simply use them and enjoy access to them. It’s reasonable to speculate that these vehicles, likely owned in fleets, won’t be fancy – they’ll be vanilla Android cars. But there will probably also be another ‘class’ of vehicles – the iOS cars – for those who still care about owning or using a premium vehicle. These might include luxury cars, special work vehicles, or collectors’ items – the important unifying factor being, these vehicles are &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; by people who &lt;em&gt;care about ownership&lt;/em&gt;, whereas the vanilla fleet will be used by people who don’t care about fancy ownership – they just need to get places. Either you care about X, or you don’t.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;20.386861313869&quot;&gt;This idea of bifurcated distributions replacing Gaussian distributions maps to the Access Economy idea, which I’ve written about previously, in an interesting way. We may see X Markets of the future that are governed first by a sorting function: Do you really care about X? Do you need your own X, or is access to X enough? Are you a big Taylor Swift fan, and own all her records? (As Taylor wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-taylor-swift-the-future-of-music-is-a-love-story-1404763219&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her famous WSJ op-ed&lt;/a&gt; last year – part of what makes music special is the contingent of fans who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care, and continue to faithfully buy specific artists’ records even while they stream others’.) Or do you listen to her from time to time on Apple Music, and that’s enough?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you sufficiently well off to pay an old-fashioned, prestigious university degree? Or do you simply need access to online course material and learning opportunity? There’s little doubt that our higher education system will see some sort of shakeup in the next few decades, and to me this looks like a potential bifurcation situation: colleges and universities are getting way too expensive across the board; and yet, students who pay top dollar and go to prestigious schools &lt;em&gt;usually do well!&lt;/em&gt; And furthermore, the amount of online learning opportunities available are exploding – that’s not the problem either. The issue is the big, fat middle that doesn’t serve anybody particularly well – and is sustainable for the most part because we feel like it’s important. We’ll see how long that lasts. (It could be a while, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your company need to lock down a particularly valuable employee to a long-term contract? Or does it simply need access to a steady stream of available talent? For the most part, we don’t get a clear view into how top performing companies structure their compensation from the top all the way down to the bottom – usually we hear about the executive suite and that’s it. But there’s a great exception: professional sports teams, where team salary and cap hit information is usually available. And on these teams, we’ve seen this same thing emerging: either you’re a star, or you’re replacement level. The middle ground is vanishing: either you’re locked up to a multi-year blockbuster deal, or you’re on a one-year, market rate contract that’s pretty indistinguishable from any other. Outside of the sports leagues, where we don’t have such a privileged view, is this happening as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see, too, that these bifurcations are driven by a shift from a world of scarcity to a world of abundance. Buying an album used to be the only way to listen to your own music – now it streams online, quasi-free, always. Learning material used to be precious and valuable – now it’s abundantly available online, everywhere. Employee retention used to be critical for companies from top to bottom – now freelance and temporary labour is abundant, and only the truly scarce need be locked down. These decisions, which were once multifactorial, are becoming single-variable: either you care about X, or you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a dark side to this idea: its sinister cousin, economic inequality. We typically celebrate and value an upwardly mobile society with a “healthy middle class”; in other words, a society whose incomes form a Gaussian distribution. But in a world shifting towards one of abundance, where one would hope that rising tides would lift all boats, could this bifurcation be slowly and irreversibly happening as well? Are we heading towards a two-class system: a class of owners and a class of users? I’ll save this question for part three: I still have a lot of personal research to do before I’m able to properly form an opinion here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, what can we take away from this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Normal distributions come from multifactorial situations, where many variables matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In a world governed by scarcity, our decisions and preferences tend to be multifactorial in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In a world governed by abundance, on the other hand, our decisions are no longer multifactorial. They tend to be dominated by one factor above all others: either X matters to you, or it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-If the world is moving in this direction, we might anticipate other industries and ecosystems that could follow. Education, cars, banking, and employment come to mind as examples; there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The fall of the normal distribution maps to the rise of the access economy: ownership and access are not part of the same distribution; they are two halves of a bifurcation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Improving support for adult content on Mastodon</title>
<link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/05/improving-support-for-adult-content-on-mastodon/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/05/improving-support-for-adult-content-on-mastodon/</guid>
<description>&lt;header class=&quot;article-header&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Blurhash in Mastodon 2.8.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/05/improving-support-for-adult-content-on-mastodon/hero.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest point release of Mastodon adds a small new feature that might have a significant impact on all adult content creators on the platform. The feature has a fancy, memorable name: Blurhash. But first, let’s talk about how adult content works on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon allows you to put content warnings on posts. These can be textual, hiding the text content, for example if you want to talk about spoilers or something uncomfortable for other people. Images and videos can be hidden as well, even while leaving the text visible. When the images and videos are hidden, you only see a black box where they would be, that can be clicked to show them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond providing visual protection against say, co-workers looking over your shoulder to see something inappropriate on your screen, Mastodon also does not load said images or videos at all until you choose to unhide them, which helps if it’s important that inappropriate content is not stored in your browser’s cache. But there is a drawback. Every post with hidden media looks the same. They all blend together. Especially in public timelines, which provide a stream of all public posts that people use to explore Mastodon outside of their friend circle. As a result, posts with hidden media usually get less interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/05/improving-support-for-adult-content-on-mastodon/blurhash-demo-cat.png&quot; alt=&quot;Side-by-side comparison of the original picture of Doris (cat) and the generated blurhash, which is the string KJG8_@Dgx]_4V?xuyE%NRj&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side-by-side comparison of the original picture of Doris (cat) and the generated blurhash, which is the string KJG8_@Dgx]_4V?xuyE%NRj&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes Blurhash. Developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@WAHa_06x36&quot;&gt;Dag Ågren&lt;/a&gt;, who is behind the popular iOS app for Mastodon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/toot/id1229021451?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Toot!&lt;/a&gt;, it is an algorithm that compresses a picture into a short string of letters. The string is so small that there is no problem with saving it in the database, instead of as an image file, and conversely, sending it along with API responses. That means that string is available before any image files are loaded by the browser. You can see where this is going… When you decode the string back into an image, you get a gradient of colors used in the original image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So little information is transmitted through blurhash that is is safe to display even if the underlying content is inappropriate, and the resulting gradient is pleasant to look at. Even more importantly, it’s different for each image, making posts with hidden media look different from each other, which should hopefully increases their chances of getting noticed. But that’s not all! Even for posts where images and videos are not supposed to be hidden, it provides a pleasant placeholder while the much heavier image files are loaded by the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use Blurhash in your project, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/blurhash&quot;&gt;Ruby port&lt;/a&gt; on RubyGems and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/blurhash&quot;&gt;JavaScript port&lt;/a&gt; on NPM. More are to be published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@WAHa_06x36&quot;&gt;Dag Ågren&lt;/a&gt; in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;3b4a&quot; id=&quot;3b4a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“You are not your user”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reminder that you are not designing the product for people like yourself. Often used as a way to encourage more user research in a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4180&quot; id=&quot;4180&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“If Henry Ford had asked people what they wanted, they would have told him faster horses”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Used as a counter-argument to the previous statement, when you start to realize you won’t have time or money to do enough user research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a91&quot; id=&quot;7a91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“We are testing the design, not your skills”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Disclaimer given to users at the start of a user testing session to make them feel better about being a little stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;22ae&quot; id=&quot;22ae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Designers should have a seat at the table”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When you are not able to prove your strategic value to the company based on your everyday actions and behaviors, and you have to beg to be invited to important meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bd8a&quot; id=&quot;bd8a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Choices should be limited to 7 plus or minus 2”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A nicer way of saying that choices should range from 5 to 9, without sounding too broad. When in reality every good designer knows choices should range from 1 to 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;56f0&quot; id=&quot;56f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit; they want a quarter-​inch hole”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Wait, do they really want a hole? Or do they want wireless Bluetooth instead, so no holes are needed whatsoever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c077&quot; id=&quot;c077&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“UX should be a mindset, not a step in the process”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you realize the deadline is coming close and you haven’t been able to finish your deliverables. Used to try to retroactively convince the PM to extend the project timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1803&quot; id=&quot;1803&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Content is king”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A pretty strong argument to convince everyone to push the deadline because you haven’t received the content that will go on the page you are designing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b794&quot; id=&quot;b794&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Never underestimate the stupidity of the user”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An efficient way of outsourcing your own responsibility of giving users enough context so they know what to do (a.k.a. being a good designer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;99b9&quot; id=&quot;99b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“I’m wondering if this breaks accessibility standards”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used as last resort when you are running out of arguments to convince other designers their design is not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a35&quot; id=&quot;4a35&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“A user interface is like a joke; if you have to explain it, it’s not that good”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easy way of killing that onboarding wizard/walkthrough idea your stakeholders are asking for. Watch out for the backfire: others might agree with your argument and blame on you the fact that the product is not that working that well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c765&quot; id=&quot;c765&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“People don’t scroll”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The most offensive statement you can throw at a designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af14&quot; id=&quot;af14&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“People are used to scrolling; think about the way you use Instagram”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A polite counter-argument to the previous statement. The Instagram example can be replaced by any other feed-based product your interlocutor might be addicted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5e33&quot; id=&quot;5e33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“The fold doesn’t exist”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If you can’t convince them, confuse them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f32c&quot; id=&quot;f32c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“UI vs. UX”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Pzajsodiajhsknfksdjbfsdbfkqwehjoqiwejroe. Usually followed by even more cliché analogies of ketchup bottles or unpaved walkways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e829&quot; id=&quot;e829&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“All pages should be accessible in 3 clicks”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Just. Don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a16&quot; id=&quot;8a16&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Should designers code?”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A commonly used wild card when the audience is running out of questions in a Q&amp;amp;A session at a design event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f8d0&quot; id=&quot;f8d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A passive-aggressive way of explaining to clients you will not reduce your price. Usually ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d429&quot; id=&quot;d429&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“You can’t design an experience; experiences are too subjective to be designed”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;An argument used by coworkers who are running out of things to say but somehow still want to sound smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c41e&quot; id=&quot;c41e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Let the users decide”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of us is going to win this endless argument, so we should take this to c̶o̶u̶r̶t̶ user testing. But I’m still going to prove you wrong at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;527c&quot; id=&quot;527c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“No one enters a website through the homepage anymore”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Popular at the peak of the SEO era (2005–2008), the argument was used to cut short endless meetings where a large group of stakeholders is trying to design your homepage by committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5fbc&quot; id=&quot;5fbc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“The only other industry who names their customers ‘users’ are drug dealers”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can’t even explain why this one exists. Used a lot when the term UX came about in the early 2000s, is becoming pretty popular again in the “designing for addiction” era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9dc1&quot; id=&quot;9dc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“When escalators break, they actually become stairs”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally used to explain the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;graceful degradation&lt;/a&gt;, the quote started being adopted by developers to convince the product owner that certain bugs do not need to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2062&quot; id=&quot;2062&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Mobile users are distracted”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Just a generalization made by someone who still thinks the primary use case for mobile devices is on-the-go, while doing groceries and simultaneously trying to tame a wild giraffe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e3ab&quot; id=&quot;e3ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“You don’t know what you don’t know”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Honestly, no one knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;51df&quot; id=&quot;51df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Leave your ego by the door”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An inspirational quote used before you walk into a user testing session or a collaborative work session with your coworkers. Looks particularly great if written in Helvetica, printed and framed, and hung by the entrance of truly collaborative office spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;448e&quot; id=&quot;448e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Double diamond”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Hey, we need a slide in this deck that represents our design process — can you come up with something that is relatively simple to understand, that will make us look less chaotic than we actually are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;525a&quot; id=&quot;525a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“Users don’t read”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An overly used argument to convince clients and stakeholders to cut copy length in half. If you made this far to this article, you’re living proof that this statement is untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
