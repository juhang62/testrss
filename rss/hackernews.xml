<description>&lt;p&gt;15 Sep 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week my in-laws politely but firmly asked me to set up their new HP printer. I protested that I’m completely clueless about that sort of thing, despite my tax-return-job-title of “software engineer”. Still remonstrating, I was gently bundled into their study with an instruction pamphlet, a cup of tea, a promise to unlock the door once I’d printed everyone’s passport forms, and a warning not to try the window because the roof tiles are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first the setup process was so simple that even a computer programmer could do it. But then, after I had finished removing pieces of cardboard and blue tape from the various drawers of the machine, I noticed that the final step required the downloading of an app of some sort onto a phone or computer. This set off my crapware detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/images/hp-cover.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that I was being too cynical. I suppose that it was theoretically possible that the app could have been a thoughtfully-constructed wizard, which did nothing more than gently guide non-technical users through the sometimes-harrowing process of installing and testing printer drivers. It was at least conceivable that it could then quietly uninstall itself, satisfied with a simple job well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in reality it was a way to try and get people to sign up for expensive ink subscriptions and/or hand over their email addresses, plus something even more nefarious that we’ll talk about shortly (there were also some instructions for how to download a printer driver tacked onto the end). This was a shame, but not unexpected. I’m sure that the HP ink department is saddled with aggressive sales quotas, and no doubt the only way to hit them is to ruthlessly exploit people who don’t know that third-party cartridges are just as good as HP’s and are much cheaper. Fortunately, the careful user can still emerge unscathed from this phase of the setup process by gingerly navigating the UI patterns that presumably do fool some people who aren’t paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/images/hp-instant-ink.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is only then, once the user has found the combination of “Next” and “Cancel” buttons that lead out of the swamp of hard sells and bad deals, that they are confronted with their biggest test: the “Data Collection Notice &amp;amp; Settings”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/images/hp-data-collection.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, HP wants its printer to collect all kinds of data that a reasonable person would never expect it to. This includes metadata about your devices, as well as information about all the documents that you print, including timestamps, number of pages, and the application doing the printing (HP state that they do stop short of looking at the contents of your documents). &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190828162443/https://www8.hp.com/us/en/privacy/privacy.html&quot;&gt;From the HP privacy policy, linked to from the setup program:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Usage Data – We collect product usage data such as pages printed, print mode, media used, ink or toner brand, file type printed (.pdf, .jpg, etc.), application used for printing (Word, Excel, Adobe Photoshop, etc.), file size, time stamp, and usage and status of other printer supplies. We do not scan or collect the content of any file or information that might be displayed by an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Device Data – We collect information about your computer, printer and/or device such as operating system, firmware, amount of memory, region, language, time zone, model number, first start date, age of device, device manufacture date, browser version, device manufacturer, connection port, warranty status, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers and additional technical information that varies by product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP wants to use the data they collect for a wide range of purposes, the most eyebrow-raising of which is for serving advertising. Note the last column in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/pdf/privacy/HP_Privacy_Matrix.pdf&quot;&gt;“Privacy Matrix”&lt;/a&gt;, which states that “Product Usage Data” and “Device Data” (amongst many other types of data) are collected and shared with “service providers” for purposes of advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP delicately balances short-term profits with reasonable-man-ethics by only half-obscuring the checkboxes and language in this part of the setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/images/hp-opened.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point everything has become clear - the job of this setup app is not only to sell expensive ink subscriptions; it’s also to collect what apparently passes for informed consent in a court of law. I clicked the boxes to indicate “Jesus Christ no, obviously not, why would anyone ever knowingly consent to that”, and then spent 5 minutes Googling how to make sure that this setting was disabled. My research suggests that it’s controlled by an item in the settings menu of the printer itself labelled “Store anonymous usage information”. However, I don’t think any reasonable person would think that the meaning of “Store anonymous usage information” includes “send analytics data back to HP’s servers so that it can be used for targeted advertising”, so either HP is being deliberately coy or there’s another option that disables sending your data that I haven’t found yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet there’s also a vigorous debate to be had over whether HP’s definition of “anonymous” is the same as mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagine that a user’s data is exfiltrated back to HP by the printer itself, rather than any client-side software. Once HP has a user’s data then I don’t know what they do with it. Maybe if they can see that you are printing documents from Photoshop then they can send you spam for photo paper? I also don’t know anything about how much a user’s data is worth. My guess is that it’s depressingly little. I’d almost prefer it if HP was snatching highly valuable information that was worth making a high-risk, high-reward play for. But I can’t help but feel like they’re just grabbing whatever data is lying around because they might as well, it might be worth a few cents, and they (correctly) don’t anticipate any real risk to their reputation and bottom line from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertheaton.com/images/hp-recommended.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended for who?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m further unsure how a user’s printing data is connected back to the rest of their identity and used to power online advertising. It could be some combination of IP address, printer and computer MAC addresses, a serial number of some sort, or maybe just if the user gave HP their email address as part of setting up an expensive ink subscription. I pondered this question in some detail once I had set up my in-laws’ printer. I wanted to use the extremely convenient feature where the printer scans a document and sends it to you via email, but then I got scared that HP would purloin my email address, associate it with my printing data, and ship this information over to an online ad retargeting platform. I’m not a lawyer and I can’t be bothered to properly parse their privacy policy to understand whether this technically falls under “product usage” or “sharing with third-party services”, or whether I really did manage to tick and untick the right combination of boxes to make it clear that I don’t want them to do this. I especially can’t be bothered to have the debate over whether taking the hash of an email address suddenly makes it completely anonymous and harmless (it doesn’t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When programmers write code, they also write “unit tests” in order to verify that the code works as expected. Whenever I find out about a grubby design decision made by a technology company, I always find it fun to muse about what the unit tests must look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/nyregion/doordash-tip-policy.html
describe 'when a Doordash driver receives a tip' {
  it 'keeps the extra money and does not give it to the driver' {
    driver_pay_with_tip = calculate_pay(tip = 10)
    driver_pay_without_tip = calculate_pay(tip = 0)

    assert_equal(driver_pay_with_tip, driver_pay_without_tip)
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;describe 'when a user prints a document' {
  it 'sends metadata on their activity back to HP servers' {
    print_file()
    assert(data_was_received())
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the people who are actually writing these unit tests: I know that we all accumulate status and pay rises and health insurance inside our companies that don’t always carry over into the rest of the world. I know that it can be hard to voice dissent, especially at decisions where the harm is nebulous and is only what everyone else is doing anyway. And I’m sure that it’s especially hard to reconcile conflicting emotions when you’re otherwise quite proud of the low-cost, reasonable-quality printers that your division churns out, spyware notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually it’s only now that I’ve started this bit that I realize I don’t have a punchline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where’s the harm in all this? I think it depends on what you care about and how much. I’m personally allergic to this kind of data-appropriation because I don’t believe I gain anything from it and the scummy tactics that try (and mostly succeed) to get my data just viscerally piss me off. But even if you would be perfectly happy to publish all your printing and device data to the entire internet, I’d still argue that it’s a grim world in which HP feels entitled to take it from you. And if nothing else, I believe that over ninety-nine percent of people whose printer sends their data to HP have no idea that this is happening, and would much prefer if it didn’t. This is not an exaggeration - I really do think that if you surveyed every single owner of every single spy-printer, ninety-nine out of every hundred would be unaware of the data collection and would want it to stop. If this claim is right then it would put the lie to any claim that this type of data-snagging is done with users’ knowing consent. I of course have no evidence for it, but it feels plausible, and since I’m not a journalist I don’t have to obey the Journalists’ Code. I can even invent the Journalists’ Code in the same sentence as I flout it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, I really don’t think that the onus should be on me to come up with watertight reasons why HP &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; collect data on what people print in order to target them with online ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that “is it OK if we have your printer collect metadata about your devices and what you print, and then use it online advertising?” is a question that HP should even be asking. They already know the answer, and all they’re really doing is giving people who have already paid them several hundred dollars for a cheap but functional printer the opportunity to make a mistake. Life is so much harder when you feel like you’re in a constant cold war standoff with your otherwise perfectly useful gadgets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www8.hp.com/us/en/privacy/privacy.html&quot;&gt;The top of HP’s privacy policy page reads&lt;/a&gt; “HP recognizes that privacy is a fundamental human right and further recognizes the importance of privacy, security and data protection to our customers and partners worldwide.” Which just goes to show that you should probably ignore everything that a company says that doesn’t carry a specific and enforceable legal obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If pressed then I would have to concede that HP have at least made it possible for a moderately informed and motivated user (i.e. me) to work out the gist of what they are hoping to do with my data. They’ve camouflaged, but (as far as I can tell) they haven’t lied, and I imagine that they’ve been careful not to do anything illegal. And at the end of the day, how else is a company meant to persuade users to part with data that they would never knowingly part with if they properly understood what was happening?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let Children Get Bored Again</title>
<link>https://mobile.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/children-bored.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mobile.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/children-bored.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’m bored.” It’s a puny little phrase, yet it has the power to fill parents with a cascade of dread, annoyance and guilt. If someone around here is bored, someone else must have failed to enlighten or enrich or divert. And how can anyone — child or adult — claim boredom when there’s so much that can and should be done? Immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But boredom is something to experience rather than hastily swipe away. And not as some kind of cruel Victorian conditioning, recommended because it’s awful and toughens you up. Despite the lesson most adults learned growing up — boredom is for boring people — boredom is useful. It’s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If kids don’t figure this out early on, they’re in for a nasty surprise. School, let’s face it, can be dull, and it isn’t actually the teacher’s job to entertain as well as educate. Life isn’t meant to be an endless parade of amusements. “That’s right,” a mother says to her daughter in Maria Semple’s 2012 novel, “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/books/whered-you-go-bernadette-a-maria-semple-novel.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where’d You Go, Bernadette&lt;/a&gt;.” “You are bored. And I’m going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it’s boring now? Well, it only gets more boring. The sooner you learn it’s on you to make life interesting, the better off you’ll be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;People used to accept that much of life was boring. Memoirs of pre-21st-century life are rife with tedium. When not idling in drawing rooms, members of the leisured class took long walks and stared at trees. They went motoring and stared at more trees. Those who had to work had it a lot harder. Agricultural and industrial jobs were often mind-numbing; few people were looking to be fulfilled by paid labor. Children could expect those kinds of futures and they got used to the idea from an early age, left unattended with nothing but bookshelves and tree branches, and later, bad afternoon television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Only a few short decades ago, during the lost age of underparenting, grown-ups thought a certain amount of boredom was appropriate. And children came to appreciate their empty agendas. In an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/unexpected-lin-manuel-miranda&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with GQ magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Lin-Manuel Miranda credited his unattended afternoons with fostering inspiration. “Because there is nothing better to spur creativity than a blank page or an empty bedroom,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nowadays, subjecting a child to such inactivity is viewed as a dereliction of parental duty. In a much-read story in The Times, “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/upshot/the-relentlessness-of-modern-parenting.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Relentlessness of Modern Parenting&lt;/a&gt;,” Claire Cain Miller cited a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sf/soy107/5257458&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; that found that regardless of class, income or race, parents believed that “children who were bored after school should be enrolled in extracurricular activities, and that parents who were busy should stop their task and draw with their children if asked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Every spare moment is to be optimized, maximized, driven toward a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When not being uberparented, kids today are left to their own devices — their own digital devices, that is. Parents preparing for a long car ride or airplane trip are like Army officers plotting a complicated land maneuver. Which movies to load onto the iPad? Should we start a new family-friendly podcast? Is this an O.K. time to let the kids play Fortnite until their brains melt into the back seat? What did parents in the ’70s do when kids were bored in the way-back? Nothing! They let them breathe in gas fumes. Torture their siblings. And since it wasn’t actually for wearing, play with the broken seatbelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If you complained about being bored back then, you were really asking for it. “Go outside,” you might get, or worse, “Clean your room.” Was this fun? No. Was it helpful? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Because things happen when you’re bored. Some of the most boring jobs I’ve had were also the most creative. Working at an import factory after school, I pasted photos of ugly Peruvian sweaters onto sales sheets. My hands became encrusted with glue as the sweaters blurred into a clumpy sameness. For some reason, everything smelled like molasses. My mind had no choice but to drift into an elaborate fantasy realm. It’s when you are bored that stories set in. Checking out groceries at the supermarket, I invented narratives around people’s purchases. The man buying eggplant and a six-pack of Bud at 9 p.m.: Which was the must-get item and which the impulse purchase? How did my former fifth-grade teacher feel about my observing her weekly purchase of Nutter Butters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Once you’ve truly settled into the anesthetizing effects of boredom, you find yourself en route to discovery. With monotony, small differences begin to emerge, between those trees, those sweaters. This is why so many useful ideas occur in the shower, when you’re held captive to a mundane activity. You let your mind wander and follow it where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Of course, it’s not really the boredom itself that’s important; it’s what we do with it. When you reach your breaking point, boredom teaches you to respond constructively, to make something happen for yourself. But unless we are faced with a steady diet of stultifying boredom, we never learn how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The idea isn’t that you suffer through crushing tedium indefinitely like Neville (“N is for Neville who died of ennui”) of “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/gorey-edward-the-gashlycrumb-tinies-1963-887857.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Gashlycrumb Tinies&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s that you learn how to vanquish it. This may come in several forms: You might turn inward and use the time to think. You might reach for a book. You might imagine your way to a better job. Boredom leads to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2014.901073#preview&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flights of fancy&lt;/a&gt;. But ultimately, to self-discipline. To resourcefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The ability to handle boredom, not surprisingly, is correlated with the ability to focus and to self-regulate. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-012-3147-z&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that people with attention disorders are particularly prone to boredom. It makes sense that in a hyperstimulating world, what at first seems captivating now feels less so; what was once mildly diverting may now be flat-out dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s especially important that kids get bored — and be allowed to stay bored — when they’re young. That it not be considered “a problem” to be avoided or eradicated by the higher-ups, but instead something kids grapple with on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We’ve stopped training children to do this. Rather than teach them to absorb material that is slower, duller and decidedly two-dimensional, like a lot of worthwhile information is, schools cave in to what they say children expect: fun. Teachers spend more time concocting ways to “engage” students through visuals and “interactive learning” (read: screens, games) tailored to their Candy Crushed attention spans. Kids won’t listen to long lectures, goes the argument, so it’s on us to serve up learning in easier-to-swallow portions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But surely teaching children to endure boredom rather than ratcheting up the entertainment will prepare them for a more realistic future, one that doesn’t raise false expectations of what work or life itself actually entails. One day, even in a job they otherwise love, our kids may have to spend an entire day answering Friday’s leftover email. They may have to check spreadsheets. Or assist robots at a vast internet-ready warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This sounds boring, you might conclude. It sounds like work, and it sounds like life. Perhaps we should get used to it again, and use it to our benefit. Perhaps in an incessant, up-the-ante world, we could do with a little less excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;video-desc&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Imagine visiting a country and being unable to leave. That scenario, a reality for many Americans visiting China, subject to a so-called “exit ban.” &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Buzz60, Buzz60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-1 p-text&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON – Two young Americans, Victor and Cynthia Liu, are “trapped” in China, increasingly desperate and despondent because &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2hBtXdaYsQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chinese authorities have blocked&lt;/a&gt; them from leaving for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-2 p-text&quot;&gt;“They are trapped. They are alone. They are desperate to come home,” David Pressman, the siblings’ New York-based attorney, told USA TODAY. “They are literally breaking down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The Lius are subject to a so-called &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“exit ban,”&lt;/a&gt; and they’re not they only ones.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Another American citizen, &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WanHuang2/status/1136491372897288192&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huang Wan&lt;/a&gt;, says Chinese officials are using a “fake” legal case to prevent her from returning to the United States. An Australian resident, &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/08/wife-of-detained-australian-writer-yang-hengjun-banned-from-leaving-china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yuan Xiaoliang,&lt;/a&gt; has been barred from leaving China for more than eight months, and her husband, an Australian citizen, has been arrested on suspicion of spying, according to &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://foreignminister.gov.au/releases/Pages/2019/mp_mr_190827.aspx?w=E6pq%2FUhzOs%2BE7V9FFYi1xQ%3D%3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Australia’s foreign minister&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The State Department has &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;warned Americans&lt;/a&gt; about China’s growing use of exit bans – stating in a Jan. 3 travel advisory that Chinese authorities have sometimes used exit bans to keep Americans in China for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“China uses exit bans coercively,” the State Department cautioned, “to compel U.S. citizens to participate in Chinese government investigations, to lure individuals back to China from abroad, and to aid Chinese authorities in resolving civil disputes in favor of Chinese parties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Thomas Kellogg, executive director of the Center for Asian Law at Georgetown University Law Center, said China has long used exit bans to stop its own citizens from leaving the country, particularly human-rights activists or other dissidents. But authorities are increasingly using the tactic to harass Americans and other foreign nationals, particularly those of Chinese descent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“We don’t have firm numbers in terms of exactly how many people, on either the Chinese side or the international side, have been subjected to exit bans … but we know that the number is quite large,” Kellogg said. Thousands of Chinese citizens have been subject to exit bans in recent years, he said, along with an unknown number of foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Kellogg and other experts say the bitter U.S.-China trade war has exacerbated the trend, along with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s efforts to consolidate power and stifle dissent. Xi has purged opponents often using the &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://beta.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/chinas-attack-on-human-rights-and-the-rule-of-law-continues/2019/01/31/305067ee-2410-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pretext of &quot;corruption,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; overseen a massive &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/09/24/amnesty-international-china-must-end-re-education-camps-muslims/1395851002/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repression campaign&lt;/a&gt; against Muslims, and nixed term limits so he can hold onto power indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“It’s a very ominous way of governing,” said Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank. The use of exit bans, he said, &quot;is one element of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to emailed questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;video-desc&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Donald Trump orders American companies to seek alternatives to operating in China, hours after Beijing announced new trade sanctions. Analyst Amanda DeBusk says the situation is &quot;very serious,&quot; but China's tariff retaliation is not surprising. (Aug. 23) &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;AP, AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;A State Department official said the agency could not disclose the number of Americans currently subject to exit bans. But this official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, noted that Chinese authorities have “broad authority” to prevent U.S. citizens from leaving China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“U.S. officials, including the Secretary of State, regularly raise the issue of exit bans with the Chinese government and will continue to do so until we see a transparent and fair process,” the State Department official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;For the Liu siblings, the process has been anything but fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;They're being used &quot;as a crude form of human bait&quot; to lure their estranged father, Liu Changming, back to China, said Pressman, the Lius' attorney, who has served as a deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and is now an attorney with the firm Boies Schiller Flexner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The Chinese government has &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://www.lawfareblog.com/no-exit-chinas-growing-use-exit-bans-violates-international-law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accused Liu,&lt;/a&gt; a former Bank of Communications official, of being involved in a $1.4 billion fraud scheme. Liu &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;http://m.people.cn/n/2015/0423/c31-2798440.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fled China&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, and he is no longer in touch with his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;This man abandoned my family many years ago,&quot; Cynthia Liu said in &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-siblings-trapped-in-china-make-public-plea-for-help/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an emotional video&lt;/a&gt; she recorded in May 2019, which aired on CBS News. &quot;We are not in touch with him, nor do we have any way of contacting him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Victor and Cynthia Liu traveled to China in June 2018 with their mother, Sandra Han, to visit an elderly relative. After their trip, Victor Liu was planning to start his sophomore year at Georgetown University, and Cynthia was set to return to work at a consulting firm in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;But those plans were derailed when Han was detained, and her children were barred from returning to the U.S. Victor and Cynthia are able to move around within China, they cannot leave the country, Pressman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Kellogg said Huang Wan's case is similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;She hasn’t been accused of any crime. She seems to have been subject to an exit ban merely because of her association with political figures who have been disgraced and purged,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The disgraced figures in this instance are Huang's husband and her father-in-law, who were charged and convicted in corruption cases. Her father-in-law, Zhou Yongkang, was a senior member of China's ruling community party but came under investigation after Xi Jinping came to power and has since been sentenced to life in prison, according to an account in &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://chinachange.org/2019/07/05/officials-came-in-troves-daughter-in-law-of-former-ccp-security-tsar-paints-details-of-asset-grab/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;China Change&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S.-based group that provides information on human rights in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Huang says she was also detained and held for several years, starting in December 2013, and then placed on probation. She was supposed to be free this summer but then came the exit ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;On June 6, Ms. Huang, an American citizen since 1998, completed her probation and was finally free,&quot; according to the account in China Change, which relies on messages from Huang's &lt;a data-track-label=&quot;inline|intext|n/a&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WanHuang2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; and transcripts of conversations she has had with her lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;But just days before her long-awaited freedom, a civil case involving a lease dispute was brought against her which she described to her lawyer Chen Jiangang as 'fictitious' and designed to prevent her from leaving China,&quot; the China Change account states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Feng Chongyi, an associate professor of China Studies at the University of Technology in Australia, says China's security forces have used exit bans &quot;more and more frequently because this punishment can apply to a very large number of people with little administrative costs.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;He is friends with the Australian couple, Yuan Xiaoliang and her husband, Yang Hengjun, who are currently being detained in China. And he himself was detained in the country in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;I was extremely lucky to receive overwhelming international media campaign and immediate high level intervention from governments of Australia and the US,&quot; Feng said in an email to USA TODAY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;He said Yang, a writer who has been critical of the Chinese government, has been tortured and initially was &quot;sealed off from the outside world&quot; without access to legal counsel or visits by relatives. Now, he is being held in southern Beijing with two cellmates, and he has limited access to Chinese TV and newspapers.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;His wife and daughter are allowed to travel between Shanghai and Beijing, where her daughter is attending a school, he said, but they can't go home to Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text p-text-last&quot; id=&quot;article-body-p-last&quot;&gt;&quot;Better not to contact her as she is banned for interviews,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

A tall male coworker looks quizzically as she passes. A female coworker, eyes on her phone, wryly answers Martha’s rhetorical question. MARTHA: Oh no. Is there even anyone here with machine learning experience? Gotta be someone... CO-WORKER: ha ha At THIS place?&lt;/p&gt;

FLIP, a tuxedo patterned cat, sitting on a three platform cat tree tower. Martha, in foreground, looks disoriented. BIT: Sorry about that! FLIP: Somebody forgot that humans can’t see in the dark. MARTHA: ... okay, did I just hit my head or something?&lt;/p&gt;

Martha, half-recovered, tries to respond to them. BIT: No, this is actually happening! Our model predicted you’d need some machine learning answers about now. I’m BIT, by the way. FLIP: And I’m FLIP. Tell us... What do you think ML is, Tragically Under-Spec’d Human? MARTHA: Uh... Name’s Martha...&lt;/p&gt;

As Martha ponders what she knows about machine learning, small icons appear in a thought balloon representing various perceived sub- fields of artificial intelligence. MARTHA: Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence, right? Along with image recognition, language processing, recommenders, self-driving cars, and... uh... ... Time-traveling Schwarzenegger’s...? Taunting Keanu Reeves...?? BIT: You got the first part right!&lt;/p&gt;

Bit draws a large oval that includes machine learning but also bisects each of the subfields, showing that ML is overlapping nearly all the sub-fields. LABELS: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MACHINE LEARNING BIT: —it’s also an essential PART of all those OTHER fields!&lt;/p&gt;

Both interlocutors engage her. FLIP: Machine learning is when computers IMPROVE at a task based on EXPERIENCE at that task, but without explicit programming. BIT: In other words, computers finally starting to take the initiative in ways they rarely have before. MARTHA: Hunh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_16.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_16_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_16.png 600w, assets/panel_16_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_16_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-16&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-16&quot;&gt;SCENE 16: Long-shot of a timeline from the late 1950s to the mid-2020s (i.e., overlapping the future a bit). Bit holds a portrait of Arthur Samuel back in the late ‘50s. Martha sits in the present day as Flip runs about. Different milestones in computing from the significant to the trivial can be seen underneath them. BIT: Arthur Samuel at IBM coined the term “machine learning” way back in 1959, just a few years after Alan Turing started talking “artificial intelligence.” MARTHA: Hold on. If machine learning has been around that long, why is it such a buzzword now?

Martha looks at the diagram as Flip looks at Martha. BIT: New engineering insights, well-curated big datasets, and hardware that can keep pace have all converged to make today’s ML shine! FLIP: And by “shine” he means it can produce useful results before the heat death of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

Bit and Flip continue to explain. MARTHA: That’s cool and all but “...without explicit programming” sounds fishy... I mean, it’s all in the code somewhere. How is ML different from the way I program now? FLIP: ML is powered by data, not instructions. We’ll show you. Hey, Bit—ML Metaphor Mode! BIT: Sure thing!&lt;/p&gt;

Bit rises with a whirl and turns blank-eyed, ready for his “metaphor mode” demo. FLIP: Let’s try some classification. We can start with... ...this fork! MARTHA (small letters): Where were you hiding that?&lt;/p&gt;

Bit responds. Martha, again, is skeptical. FLIP: Now what’s this? BIT: I am... 80% certain that’s a fork. MARTHA: Pft. But that’s easy. I can do that without ML, and with 100% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

Flip looks mischievous. Bit floats nearby not listening, happily contemplating forks and spoons. MARTHA (Code in Word Balloon): if ((thing.isStainlessSteel() OR Thing.isWood()) AND (thing.hasFourTines() OR Thing.hasThreeTines()) {isFork(); }else {isNotFork(); } FLIP: Okay, fair enough...&lt;/p&gt;

Martha struggles to move the fork as Bit continues happily floating about with utensils. FLIP: ...but now do that for every type of FORK in the world: Plastic forks, antique forks, two-tined forks, five-tined forks, giant forks, glass forks... MARTHA: Uh...no! I’d have to write out all the possible characteristics that make something a fork. To define “forkiness” itself!&lt;/p&gt;

FLIP: Exactly! But with ML, if you have enough well-curated data— —and run it through enough training and testing...&lt;/p&gt;

Martha is surprised. SIGN: PULL FOR LABELED DATA BIT: Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;

Flip hops off the podium. MARTHA: Okay, I’m starting to see your point. BIT: Obviously, there’s a lot more to it in real life, and ML covers more than just classification... FLIP: But on the whole, ML’s data-centric approach makes it great at learning by example, finding patterns in data, and predicting outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Bit response to Martha. Flip comments to Bit. MARTHA: Sounds great, but how can a machine “learn,” exactly? BIT: So, let’s say you want to predict the prices of houses in Portland, Oregon... MARTHA: Hold on. Does it have to be Portland? These examples are always in Portland. FLIP: Aren’t ALL houses in Portland?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_32.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_32_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_32.png 600w, assets/panel_32_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_32_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-32&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-32&quot;&gt;SCENE 32: Ten miniature houses (each about 10 inches high) tumble into Martha’s hands, startling her. Some small figures fall out of the houses. Flip brandishes her claws at a tiny family, running away. MARTHA: ACK! BIT: Now, let’s say you know just the SIZE and PRICE of only ten houses... How could you use that dataset to guess the price of OTHERS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_33.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_33_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_33.png 600w, assets/panel_33_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_33_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-33&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-33&quot;&gt;SCENE 33: Martha, mostly recovered, places tiny house icons onto a simple spreadsheet. A corresponding simple X and Y matrix appears mid panel, plotting price and square footage. A trend-line runs through the 10 dots representing each of the 10 houses. MARTHA: I guess I’d pop ‘em into a spreadsheet, and then plot X and Y coordinates and a trend-line like in high school algebra. BIT: Exactly! Just linear regression. Nothing fancy. FLIP: Now add TEN MORE houses!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_34.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_34_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_34.png 600w, assets/panel_34_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_34_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-34&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-34&quot;&gt;SCENE 34: More dots appear as 10 more houses are added to the chart. Martha notices that the line seems a bit off. Bit and Flip look on in happy anticipation. MARTHA: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_35.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_35_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_35.png 600w, assets/panel_35_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_35_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-35&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-35&quot;&gt;SCENE 35: Martha redraws the trend-line to fit the additional data— MARTHA: Lemme just... Adjust that angle a bit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_36.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_36_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_36.png 600w, assets/panel_36_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_36_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-36&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-36&quot;&gt;SCENE 36: —and looks on appreciatively at her results. MARTHA: There. Much better. BIT and FLIP (in unison): AH-HAH!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_37.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_37_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_37.png 600w, assets/panel_37_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_37_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-37&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-37&quot;&gt;SCENE 37: Flip pounces onto Martha’s chest, as Bit flies directly towards her. Both are delighted to make their point. Martha is taken aback by their aggressive glee. BIT: LOOK WHAT YOU DID THERE: You used DATA to form a HYPOTHESIS, NEW data exposed ERRORS in your hypothesis, you intuitively MEASURED that error gap, then ADJUSTED your hypothesis to fit! FLIP: Humans CAN learn! It’s a MIRACLE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_38.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_38_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_38.png 600w, assets/panel_38_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_38_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-38&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-38&quot;&gt;SCENE 38: Martha good-naturedly brushes aside the interlocutors chiding them for overreacting. But Bit and Flip are not deterred. MARTHA: Oh, CUT IT OUT, you dorks! I just saw what was wrong and fixed it... Like ANYONE would. BIT: “AnyONE” maybe, but not anyTHING. We machines can’t rely on “intuition” to tell forks from spoons or predict housing costs in the only city with houses! FLIP: Reducing errors in ML is a journey, to be taken one step at a time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_39.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_39_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_39.png 600w, assets/panel_39_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_39_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-39&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-39&quot;&gt;SCENE 39: A series of 8 charts show both trend lines (for regression) and decision boundaries (for classification) in various configurations, and various level s of accuracy. Flip stands astride a simple bar chart showing the ups and downs of their respective levels of error. FLIP: Whether for classification or regression problems, ML typically starts with a HYPOTHESIS and, of course, some hypotheses will prove MORE WRONG than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_40.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_40_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_40.png 600w, assets/panel_40_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_40_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-40&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-40&quot;&gt;SCENE 40: Martha now stands unsteadily atop a similar—but now gigantic—bar chart forming a perilous landscape of wildly varying error rates (somewhat resembling the skyline of a city). Martha is nervous to be up so high. Bit and Flip continue their explanations as if nothing’s wrong. BIT: As ML ADJUSTS hypotheses, that error rate will go up, down, or stay the same. And if you’re like most engineers... MARTHA: Uh, guys... Can we go DOWN now?! FLIP: Exactly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_41.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_41_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_41.png 600w, assets/panel_41_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_41_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-41&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-41&quot;&gt;SCENE 41: The bars all disappear from view but Martha still stands there, panicking at the fact that she can no longer see a way to get down. BIT: You want to get “DOWN” to where the model's error rate is at its LOWEST, so that you— MARTHA: NO. NO. I mean I LITERALLY want to climb down to— AH! Why can’t I SEE anything anymore?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_42.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_42_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_42.png 600w, assets/panel_42_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_42_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-42&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-42&quot;&gt;SCENE 42: Bit and Flip mischievously continue talking. BIT: heh FLIP: You didn’t think we’d make it that easy, did’ja?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_43.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_43_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_43.png 600w, assets/panel_43_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_43_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-43&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-43&quot;&gt;SCENE 43: Middle-ground shot of Martha kneeling. A short dotted line begins to appear underneath her as Flip begins walking left to right at a slight downward angle. Bit gestures at the invisible-but-still-present landscape all around them. MARTHA: But that error landscape... Where did it all go?? BIT: oh, it still here... all around us! FLIP: But the SHAPE of that landscape...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_44.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_44_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_44.png 600w, assets/panel_44_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_44_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-44&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-44&quot;&gt;SCENE 44: The dotted line extends slightly downward from left to right, as Flip start slowly walking. FLIP: ...that array of peaks and valleys we call an “error function” or “loss function”... ...can only be revealed—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_45.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_45_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_45.png 600w, assets/panel_45_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_45_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-45&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-45&quot;&gt;SCENE 45: Flip walks further, extending the dotted line to more clearly show a downward slope. Martha’s eyes follow Flip as Bit looks on. FLIP: —by gradually descending through it! It’s a journey we call GRADIENT DESCENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_46.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_46_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_46.png 600w, assets/panel_46_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_46_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-46&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-46&quot;&gt;SCENE 46: Bit excitedly places a mechanical carpenter’s level upon the dotted line to measure its angle of descent. Martha pulls out her phone. BIT: At every point, the model gauges the angle of steepest descent, much like this elegant antique “spirit level” used by four centuries of carpenters to— MARTHA: Oh, hey! My phone has an APP that does that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_47.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_47_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_47.png 600w, assets/panel_47_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_47_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-47&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-47&quot;&gt;SCENE 47: Bit’s mood sags, as his beloved “spirit level” is supplanted by Martha’s app. Martha exits panel right to follow Flip down the slope. BIT (last two words a bit set apart and slightly smaller): —or, okay... that works too... an “app”... MARTHA: Wait for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_48.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_48_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_48.png 600w, assets/panel_48_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_48_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-48&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-48&quot;&gt;SCENE 48: Flip stands at what appears to be the bottom of this dotted line Valley. Martha gingerly follows him, gripping the sides of the dotted line. Bit—arms drooping—floats behind her. MARTHA: So gradient descent is kinda like hiking down the SLOPES OF WRONG into the VALLEY OF RIGHT? FLIP: Yup! Or at least into the “Valley of Right Enough.” Machine learning is part data science and statistics; there’s a strong probabilistic streak to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;panel-49-animation&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_49_animation.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;preview panel-49&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_49.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_49_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_49.png 600w, assets/panel_49_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_49_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-49&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-49&quot;&gt;SCENE 49: Flip, reclining, looks on from the top half of the panel. In the bottom half of the panel is a simple animated diagram showing a ball descending to a valley (a la gradient descent) and in perfect synchronization, a trendline finding its most accurate position. This is labeled “REGRESSION”. Following that brief sequence, the two panels flip over to reveal two new animated panels along the same lines, but now with a decision boundary on the right, labeled “CLASSIFICATION.” The animation is looped, going back and forth between the two FLIP: Think descending = solving, plain and simple. Gradient descent is the learnin g process, enacted in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_50.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_50_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_50.png 600w, assets/panel_50_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_50_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-50&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-50&quot;&gt;SCENE 50: Long-shot of Martha and Flip, having reached what they thought was the bottom. Bit, who’s extended the dotted line further, is showing them that they can go lower still. FLIP: Machine learning is a young field. We’re all learning as we go, and there are plenty of ongoing challenges... ...like not getting trapped into a false bottom, AKA “local minima,” during descent. BIT: Heads-up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_51.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_51_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_51.png 600w, assets/panel_51_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_51_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-51&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-51&quot;&gt;SCENE 51: The three confer... BIT: ML is a moving target. The tools and techniques that seem entrenched today, might look very different in the next wave. FLIP: So true, buddy! For example, we’ll always want to minimize error, but gradient descent may not always be our method of choice. There are other “optimizers” as we call them. MARTHA: Hmm. Speaking of which...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_52.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_52_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_52.png 600w, assets/panel_52_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_52_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-52&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-52&quot;&gt;SCENE 52: Martha has now returned to her simple 20-house linear regression chart. She’s gesturing toward it. MARTHA: Sorry to bring us crashing back to earth, but do I seriously need some freaky, calculus-filled energy landscape just to price TWENTY DUMB HOUSES WITH ONE FEATURE EACH? BIT: Nah. FLIP: No way!&lt;/p&gt;

BIT: BUT what if there are 20 MILLION houses with 200 features each?! MARTHA: YOW! FLIP (sound f/x style): RROW!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_54.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_54_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_54.png 600w, assets/panel_54_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_54_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-54&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-54&quot;&gt;SCENE 54: Martha examines the spreadsheet. Flip clings to Martha’s blouse. MARTHA: Okay, very impressive, but I gotta say... Some of these features you’ve thrown in are a lot less important than others. I mean “size of garden gnomes”? C’mon. BIT: Aha! So are you saying some features should carry LESS WEIGHT than others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_55.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_55_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_55.png 600w, assets/panel_55_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_55_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-55&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-55&quot;&gt;SCENE 55: Knobs appear next to each feature. Martha is delighted and starts to fiddle with them. Flip looks on from Martha’s shoulder as Bit floats nearby. MARTHA: Sure, I—OH! They all have KNOBS now! Perfect! Let’s turn that feature down— —and turning that one up, and... ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_56.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_56_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_56.png 600w, assets/panel_56_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_56_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-56&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-56&quot;&gt;SCENE 56: Martha pulls back, apprehensive, as the knobs begin to turn themselves. Bit is unfazed. MARTHA: Uh... guys...? Is it my imagination— —or are these knobs starting to TURN THEMSELVES?? BIT: Hmmm. Seems so!&lt;/p&gt;

The interlocutors, by her side, look on with mischievous satisfaction. FLIP: Looks like our algorithm is starting to find ITS OWN WAY down the “Slopes of Wrong...” BIT: ...and into the “Valley of Right Enough.” MARTHA: Whoah...&lt;/p&gt;

Dials representing parameters accompany the arrows. Bottom half of panel: Arrows gone, the question mark is now a gradient descent symbol. BIT: In ML, hypotheses flow forward, tuning parameters based on available data. A best guess pops out— —and is confronted by the size and shape of its error. WORD BALLOON FROM GD SYMBOL: Dude, you're like THIS WRONG.&lt;/p&gt;

Bottom half of panel: New forward arrows with the new settings, left to right again. Gradient descent symbol indicates progress (i.e. going down the slope). FLIP: Then that knowledge is propagated back through the system to help re-tune those parameters— —in hopes of making better guesses next time. WORD BALLOON FROM SYMBOL: Ooh... Getting closer...&lt;/p&gt;

The H on left, the GD symbol on right, and simple dials in the middle. Bottom half of panel: Same as before but with only the return arrow (Flip walks on it, right to left). BIT: That iterative back-and-forth is the rhythm of most machine learning. FLIP: The “learning” part is that backflow re-tuning—known as BACKPROPAGATION here in the era of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_61.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_61_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_61.png 600w, assets/panel_61_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_61_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-61&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-61&quot;&gt;SCENE 61: Top half: Just the return arrow and the dials. Bottom half: The simplified diagram (from the top of panel 60) but with the dials covered up by a literal “black box.” BIT: And though we perfectly understand HOW backpropagation tunes those parameters— FLIP: —the resultant settings for some of today’s complex datasets aren’t so easy to untangle afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_62.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_62_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_62.png 600w, assets/panel_62_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_62_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-62&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-62&quot;&gt;SCENE 62: Martha cheerfully points to the side of her head; Bit and Flip respond. MARTHA: Fair enough, I guess... I can barely untangle what’s going on in THIS machine half the time. BIT: Hey, at least something is going on in there. FLIP: Yeah, that’s more than we can say for SOME humans at your company. MARTHA: Aww, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_63.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_63_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_63.png 600w, assets/panel_63_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_63_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-63&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-63&quot;&gt;SCENE 63: Long shot of the three. Martha holds a labeled small house in her right hand under a linear regression chart, and a labeled fork in her left hand under a classification chart. MARTHA: So, is machine learning mostly classification and regression like in our fork and house examples? BIT: Yes and no. Those are useful ingredients in many machine learning recipes... FLIP: But at the end of the day, it’s your choice of LEARNING METHOD that counts the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_64.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_64_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_64.png 600w, assets/panel_64_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_64_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-64&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-64&quot;&gt;SCENE 64: The three ponder the three categories of learning style; a name and symbol for each. BIT: And these days, there are three methods most commonly used in machine learning tasks. FLIP: Which you choose depends on what you want out of your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_65.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_65_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_65.png 600w, assets/panel_65_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_65_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-65&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-65&quot;&gt;SCENE 65: Bit gestures to a series of objects floating in mid-panel: a thermometer, house, a baseball, fork, a banana, a spoon, a forklift... Each with either an X or a check mark next to it. Martha and Flip look on. BIT: In SUPERVISED LEARNING, you use labeled examples of what you’re looking for— the so-called “right answer”—to compare your work against. MARTHA: Aha! So most of the cases we’ve discussed...? FLIP: ...are examples of supervised learning, yes. It’s the dominant group—for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_66.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_66_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_66.png 600w, assets/panel_66_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_66_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-66&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-66&quot;&gt;SCENE 66: Top half: Bit gestures with one hand to four pictures of hedgehogs, and with the other hand to four pictures that are not hedgehogs. Bottom half: Martha and Flip walk behind a pedestrian looking up pictures of hedgehogs on his phone and laughing. BIT: In supervised learning, the ML model trains on sets of labeled training data, then guesses at the labels of subsequent testing datasets, often in multiple iterations— FLIP: —until it’s ready to deploy on that final dataset called the WORLD. PEDESTRIAN ON PHONE: HA! HA! So, THAT’S what a hedgehog looks like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_67.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_67_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_67.png 600w, assets/panel_67_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_67_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-67&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-67&quot;&gt;SCENE 67: Long shot of the three gazing out a big mosaic background of movie images with cats in them. MARTHA: In UNSUPERVISED there’s no “right” answer per se. You’re on the lookout for clusters or anomalies that may turn out to be meaningful. Such as people who like the same type of movies. MARTHA AND FLIP (partially in unison): OMG I love that one! Have you seen that one though? SO GOOD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_68.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_68_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_68.png 600w, assets/panel_68_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_68_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-68&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-68&quot;&gt;SCENE 68: Bit airlifts Martha and Flip out of a giant crowd with even more movies from all around the world. BIT: ML is a great fit for this kind of work because it can take on a huge— —or hugely complex, dataset. VOICES FROM CROWD: OMG I love that one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_69.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_69_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_69.png 600w, assets/panel_69_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_69_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-69&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-69&quot;&gt;SCENE 69: A pixelated vintage arcade-style Bit zips around a maze-like game. BIT: And in REINFORCEMENT LEARNING— —the program tries to find the most efficient pathway to its goal. Successful routes get a reward. Failures, a restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_70.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_70_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_70.png 600w, assets/panel_70_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_70_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-70&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;panel-70&quot;&gt;SCENE 70: Bit emerges from the maze. Martha holds a #1 trophy as Flip looks on. BIT: Yay! FLIP: One deep reinforcement learning system was so good at classic arcade games, it could switch to a game it hadn’t played before— —and learn to win with no additional programming. MARTHA: Whoa, that’s bananas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_71.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_71_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_71.png 600w, assets/panel_71_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_71_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-71&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-71&quot;&gt;SCENE 71: Our trio return to the 3 learning category symbols to discuss further. BIT: These categories don’t account for ALL of machine learning, but they cover a lot of ground. MARTHA: So self-playing arcade games are cool and all— —but I want to hear more about practical applications. What can this stuff be used for in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_72.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_72_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_72.png 600w, assets/panel_72_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_72_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-72&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-72&quot;&gt;SCENE 72: Sample images of sound waves, alerts, brain scans, charts, etc.... FLIP (via BALLOONS AND ARROWS): Supervised learning is used in image classification— —speech and text recognition— —medical diagnostics— —and fraud detection, to name a few...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_73.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_73_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_73.png 600w, assets/panel_73_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_73_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-73&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-73&quot;&gt;SCENE 73: Sample images of network maps, personal profiles, DNA representations, blackhole shadows, etc.... BIT (via BALLOONS AND ARROWS): Unsupervised can help us visualize networks —make personal connections— —or find patterns in nature...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_74.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_74_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_74.png 600w, assets/panel_74_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_74_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-74&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-74&quot;&gt;SCENE 74: Sample images of route maps, stock charts, robots, etc.... BIT (via BALLOONS AND ARROWS): And reinforcement learning could be applied to everything from traffic management— —to market analysis— —to robot navigation that won’t look “OMG so wrong” on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_75.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_75_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_75.png 600w, assets/panel_75_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_75_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-75&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-75&quot;&gt;SCENE 75: Flip, on Martha’s shoulder, explaining. FLIP: But no matter the kind of ML, GOOD DATA is where it all begins. Say you’re using supervised learning to identify photos of, oh, I dunno... ...CATS! First you have to gather data that contain the information you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_76.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_76_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_76.png 600w, assets/panel_76_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_76_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-76&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-76&quot;&gt;SCENE 76: Same, but with images of cats in the background. MARTHA: So, I’d need to think about... dimensions, resolution, aspect ratio... Close-ups versus long shots... From what angles? Isolated or in and environment? Are kittens included? Tigers? FLIP: Exactly. You need images that encapsulate the essentials “felinity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_77.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_77_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_77.png 600w, assets/panel_77_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_77_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-77&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-77&quot;&gt;SCENE 77: Two instances of Bit examine a painting of Flip using magnifying glasses. Martha and Flip look on. FLIP: You might need humans to sort through and label the data by hand— —or, if it’s already been labeled, checking them against ground truth... or unintended biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_78.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_78_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_78.png 600w, assets/panel_78_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_78_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-78&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-78&quot;&gt;SCENE 78: Martha examines stacks of cards being provided by Flip and Bit, While assembling three thick binders of data. FLIP: Once you have well-curated and prepared data, you split it up for use in training, testing, and validation. It might require a ton of work to collect and label that much data, but it may be worth it. CAPTION (arrow to validation data): More in Part Two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_79.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_79_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_79.png 600w, assets/panel_79_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_79_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-79&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-79&quot;&gt;SCENE 79: Long shot of Martha and Flip looking at for erroneously labeled images: Flip next to a place setting marked “fork.” A fork next to a ball of yarn marked “cat.” Bit marked “grapefruit.” Magritte’s pipe marked “pipe.” LABELS: FORK CAT GRAPEFRUIT PIPE FLIP: If your data is too sloppy, homogenous, or scarce, your results could fall apart in the real world...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_80.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_80_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_80.png 600w, assets/panel_80_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_80_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-80&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-80&quot;&gt;SCENE 80: A green dotted line perfectly outlines the silhouette of the sitting cat; it’s marked “√ CAT.” A red dotted line, identical to the previous one, contradicts the silhouette of a cat clearly licking its paws; it’s marked “√ NOT CAT.” BIT: But also beware of OVERFITTING, in which your model conforms so tightly to the idiosyncrasies of your training data it can no longer generalize enough for the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_81.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_81_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_81.png 600w, assets/panel_81_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_81_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-81&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-81&quot;&gt;SCENE 81: Bit holds a platter of miscellaneous objects, talking to no one in particular. Flip turns her head, noticing that Martha is gone. BIT: But so long as you have the right data, and enough of it, you can— FLIP: Hold on! Where did she go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_82.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_82_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_82.png 600w, assets/panel_82_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_82_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-82&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-82&quot;&gt;SCENE 82: Flip and Bit hurry to catch up with Martha who’s already heading up a flight of stairs leading up to a door suspended in thin air. On the door is a small symbol, reminiscent of a brain seen from above, with network markings. MARTHA: Oooohh... Does that door lead to what I THINK it leads to? FLIP: Human, wait! Be careful up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_83.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_83_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_83.png 600w, assets/panel_83_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_83_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-83&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-83&quot;&gt;SCENE 83: The interlocutors catch up to Martha who’s gesturing towards the door. MARTHA: C’mon, we all know where this is heading. It’s machine learning’s biggest sensation nowadays: neural networks! BIT: Yes, it’s true. And yes, a lot of the examples we gave can only be done with neural nets... FLIP: But taking them on is a big step!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_84.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_84_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_84.png 600w, assets/panel_84_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_84_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-84&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-84&quot;&gt;SCENE 84: They urge her to slow down as Martha tries to open the door, finding it locked. BIT: Artificial neural networks are powerful tools, but they can eat up time and money. MARTHA: Grr. It’s locked. FLIP: Depending on the task, you might not NEED one! SOUND F/X: RATTLE RATTLE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_85.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_85_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_85.png 600w, assets/panel_85_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_85_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-85&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-85&quot;&gt;SCENE 85: Flip and Bit, seen from Martha’s POV, urging her to consider other options. Behind Flip is an envelope with arrows emanating from it. Behind Bit is a simplified decision tree. FLIP: Want to sort messages, for example? A naïve Bayes classifier is super fast and much cheaper than most neural nets. BIT: Gotta make hiring choices? A lot of people still use decision trees. Easy to understand, easy to review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_86.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_86_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_86.png 600w, assets/panel_86_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_86_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-86&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-86&quot;&gt;SCENE 86: Martha sits, frustrated, at the top of the stairs as Flip approaches. Bit holds out a large framed image of a support vector machine representation. BIT: Ooh, ooh, and support vector machines are powerful classifiers! FLIP: Who doesn’t love a wide margin? MARTHA: But... But...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_87.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_87_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_87.png 600w, assets/panel_87_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_87_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-87&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-87&quot;&gt;SCENE 87: Flip and Bit approach Martha with good-natured sympathy as she levels with them. MARTHA: I still wanna LEARN about neural networks, because... Because they... BIT: Because they’re cool? MARTHA (Smaller letters, extra space after “yeah...”): Yeah... Because they’re cool. FLIP: They ARE pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_88.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_88_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_88.png 600w, assets/panel_88_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_88_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-88&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-88&quot;&gt;SCENE 88: Martha stands, newly confident and excited. MARTHA: Y’know what? Maybe I will need a neural network and maybe I won’t, but there’s only one way to be SURE. I’m ready to go through this door and face the FUTURE. Now let’s have that KEY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;preview&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_89.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/assets/panel_89_1x.png&quot; data-srcset=&quot;assets/panel_89.png 600w, assets/panel_89_1x.png 1200w, assets/panel_89_2x.png 2400w&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;panel-89&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;panel-89&quot;&gt;SCENE 89: Bit hands Martha the key. Martha looks to the side (to the audience?), as Flip calls for the last panel. BIT: You know we were always going to give you the key, right? MARTHA: Pft. Well, yeah... This’d be a really weird comic if you didn’t! FLIP: Cue last panel!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-4-frames.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-4-frames.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2675&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-4-frames.jpg 800w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-4-frames-300x169.jpg 300w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-4-frames-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Thursday IBM unveiled their new mainframe, the z15. Overall, the z15 represents an evolutionary change over its predecessor, the z14. However, there are plenty of enhancements across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High-Level Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the system level, IBM continues to use central processor complex (CPC) drawers which incorporate the processors, memory, and I/O interconnects. A drawer on the z15 comprises two logical CP clusters and one SC. The split cluster design is intended to improve memory traffic. This is the same design as the z14. However, the similarities stop here. On the z14, a single drawer comprises six central processors and a single system controller chip. Within a drawer, everything is fully connected via the X-Bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z14_drawer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z14_drawer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2660&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z14_drawer.png 687w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z14_drawer-300x178.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the z15 IBM scaled back on the number of central processors. There are now four processors and a single SC chip per drawer. We will get as to why we believe IBM made this change later on. Within a drawer, everything is still fully connected via the X-Bus. Each processor is connected to the other processor within a cluster as well as to the SC chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_drawer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_drawer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2661&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_drawer.png 687w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_drawer-300x152.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change from six to four central processors is an interesting one. We will touch on the z15 processor in more detail late in this article but for now, we want to point out that the z15 has twelve cores per processor, two more than the z14. This means that in total, the z15 drawer has 48 cores while the z14 had 60 cores. As far as memory channels are concerned, this has not changed from the z14. There are five channels per CP for a total of 20 channels per CPC Drawer. &lt;span id=&quot;ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-adpicker-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ezoic-ad medrectangle-4 adtester-container adtester-container-104&quot; data-ez-name=&quot;wikichip_org-medrectangle-4&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-wikichip_org-medrectangle-4-0&quot; ezaw=&quot;468&quot; ezah=&quot;60&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking another step back, the full z15 system configuration supports one additional drawer compared to the z14. With up to five CPC Drawers, IBM can compensate for the reduced processor count per drawer and offer up to 190 cores or 380 threads (note that the system is overprovisioned for redundancy). Note that the max z14 configuration was capped at 170 cores so you are looking at roughly 12% more cores on the new system. By the way, the usable memory has also increased from 32 TiB to 40 TiB. Communication inter-drawer is done over the A-Bus just like in the prior architectures. With four drawers, the SC on the z14 only needed three A-Bus links. On the z15, IBM added a fourth A-Bus link in order to fully connect every drawer to every other drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;z15 Central Processor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall architecture of the chip itself is very similar to the z14. Each core has a private L1 and L2. There is a massive L3 cache that is shared by all the cores. IBM increased the core count by 2 from 10 to 12. The L3 cache has been doubled to a whopping 256 MiB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan=&quot;7&quot;&gt;L3 Cache Comparison&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;uArch&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Capacity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;128 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Organization&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12-way&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16-way&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32-way&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32-way&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Line Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/ibm/microarchitectures/z15#CP_Chip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_soc_block_diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2671&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_soc_block_diagram.png 450w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_soc_block_diagram-300x134.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to compare the cache size is by ratio to core count. The z15 nearly doubles the effective per-core L3 cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan=&quot;7&quot;&gt;L3 Cache Comparison&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;uArch&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z196&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Core Count&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Capacity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;128 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Effective per-core capacity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.8 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21.33 MiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-and-past-arch-per-core-cache.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-and-past-arch-per-core-cache.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2668&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-and-past-arch-per-core-cache.png 822w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-and-past-arch-per-core-cache-300x214.png 300w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-and-past-arch-per-core-cache-768x548.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-adpicker-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ezoic-ad banner-1 adtester-container adtester-container-106&quot; data-ez-name=&quot;wikichip_org-banner-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-wikichip_org-banner-1-0&quot; ezaw=&quot;300&quot; ezah=&quot;250&quot; class=&quot;ezoic-ad&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in July 2013, IBM introduced the IBM zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) card. With the large L3 cache, IBM decided to move the Nest Acceleration Unit (NXU) on-chip. Because the NXU is on-chip, it can perform compression directly in the L3 cache, removing the I/O bottleneck. IBM is claiming up to 17 times the throughput compared to the old zEDC card with up to 260 GB/sec of compression throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;z15 Core – Wider, IPC Uplift&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The z15 CPU improves on the prior z14. They are still manufactured on GlobalFoundries 14-nanometer using 17 metal layers. This is still &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/956/globalfoundries-14hp-process-a-marriage-of-two-technologies/&quot;&gt;14HP, a special FinFET on SOI process that was co-designed by IBM and GlobalFoundries&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, although the z15 die is identical in size to the z14, at almost 700 mm², IBM has managed to pack 3 billion more transistors – 9.1 billion transistors in total. Late in this article, we will explain the magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/ibm/microarchitectures/z15#Central_Processor_.28CP.29_Chip&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-die-f.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2676&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-die-f.png 534w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-die-f-280x300.png 280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like its predecessor, the z15 operates at up to 5.2 GHz – but now with two more cores. Compared to the z14 at 5.2 GHz, IBM claims an average 10-13% uplift in single-thread performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/ibm/microarchitectures/z15#Individual_core&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_block_diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2672&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_block_diagram.png 500w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15_block_diagram-300x269.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Front End&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the z14, the z15 features 128 KiB private L1 instruction cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan=&quot;7&quot;&gt;L1I Cache Comparison&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;96 KiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;128 KiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;128 KiB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32 KiB&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;8-way&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8-way&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8-way&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Line Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;256 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64 B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with its predecessors, the z15 continues to use a split-cache hierarchy within the core itself. On the z15, IBM doubled the size of the level 2 instruction cache to 4 MiB, reaching parity with the data cache size. Unlike any other non-IBM processor, those caches are not implemented in SRAM but, instead, use their &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/956/globalfoundries-14hp-process-a-marriage-of-two-technologies/4/&quot;&gt;highly dense eDRAM cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;z12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;z15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Capacity&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-ic-blocks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-ic-blocks.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2669&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-ic-blocks.png 800w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-ic-blocks-300x131.png 300w, https://fuse.wikichip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/z15-ic-blocks-768x335.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Improved BPU – New TAGE Predictor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asynchronously of instruction processing, the branch predictor operates ahead of the instruction stream, locating and predicting branch instructions. On the z14, IBM used a number of different algorithms. The z14 has a first level BTB and history table (BHT) as well as a second level BTB. The z14 also has a BTB pre-buffer (BTBp) which was essentially an L1 BTB1 victim cache. Once used, it passes it on to the L1 BTB. On the z15, the BTBp has been removed. Instead, it was replaced by a simpler write buffer with the two independent read ports being replaced by single double-bandwidth port. Additionally, the L1 BTB has increased from 4 sets of 2K rows to 8 sets of 2K rows. The L2 BTB is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of z14, IBM added two new predictors – a Hashed Perceptron and a simple call-return stack for target prediction. With the z15, IBM made a number of enhancements. First, the simple call-return stack can now return to branches located up to 8 bytes past the next sequential instruction. Previously, the predictor was limited to returning to the next sequential instruction. The most major addition to the z15 is the introduction of a new TAGE predictor. AMD has &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/2458/a-look-at-the-amd-zen-2-core/&quot;&gt;recently added&lt;/a&gt; the same predictor to their Zen 2 core. If you are interested, we have covered the behavior of the TAGE predictor &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/2458/a-look-at-the-amd-zen-2-core/&quot;&gt;in this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;AN IRISH TEENAGER has won an international science award for his project which removed microplastics from water. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fionn Ferreira, from Ballydehob in west Cork, has been named the overall winner of the 2019 Google Science Fair, a prestigious annual global science competition open to students aged 13 to 18.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 18-year-old was awarded a $50,000 (about €45,000) bursary at an awards ceremony at the Google international headquarters in Mountain View, California, yesterday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-4840348800521327&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2072364615&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ferreira was one of 24 finalists chosen from a shortlist of 100 regional entries that competed for the top prize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;His project examined a new method for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/2018/2c3f6207b15f46cb4bb66a56095bd6d901ccfa42e7e51600c766df7856590c4e&quot;&gt;extracting microplastics&lt;/a&gt; (plastic particles less than 5mm in diameter) from water. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microplastics or microbeads are mostly used in soaps, shower gels and facial scrubs to exfoliate skin, although they also can be found in toothpaste and abrasive cleaners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;In waterways, fish and other wildlife mistake the tiny scraps of plastic for food and, from there, the beads are integrated into the food chain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;articleContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;At present, no screening or filtering for microplastics takes place in any European wastewater treatment centres.&lt;span&gt;Ireland plans to introduce legislation that will outlaw the sale, manufacture, import and export of products &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thejournal.ie/microbeads-ban-ireland-4678312-Jun2019/&quot;&gt;containing microplastics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ferreira used ferrofluids, a combination of oil and magnetite powder, and magnets to extract microplastics from water. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-4840348800521327&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2072364615&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1,000 tests, Ferreira was able to remove over 87% of microplastics from water samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The method used was most effective on fibres obtained from a washing machine and least effective on polypropylene plastics,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ferreira stated that his proposal could “form the basis for an effective way of extracting microplastic from water”, adding: “The next step is to scale this up to an industrial scale.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ferrier sat his Leaving Certificate exams last month at Schull Community College and is due to attend university in the Netherlands. &lt;span&gt;The teenager works as a curator at the Schull Planetarium, has won 12 science fair awards, speaks three languages fluently, plays the trumpet at orchestra level, and had a minor planet named after him by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The U1 chip in the iPhone 11 is the beginning of an Ultra Wideband revolution?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/09/the-u1-chip-in-the-iphone-11-is-the-beginning-of-an-ultra-wideband-revolution/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple likes talking about the awesome chips it designs for its iPhones, but it hates even hinting at products it hasn’t yet announced. The new U1 chip—introduced with the iPhone 11 but never mentioned on stage at Tuesday’s iPhone event—strikes at the heart of this conflict. Embedded in the U1 is new technology that may dramatically change how our various intelligent devices interact with each other, but Apple is only using it to make a small addition to AirDrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the story is more complicated. If you believe the reports that Apple is &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/04/ios-13-tag-device/&quot;&gt;working on a tracking accessory&lt;/a&gt; that will let you locate just about any object with extreme precision, then the lack of a keynote mention starts to make sense. Apple will probably be ready to talk up &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwballiance.org/&quot;&gt;Ultra Wideband&lt;/a&gt; (UWB), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.decawave.com/technology1/&quot;&gt;wireless standard&lt;/a&gt; that powers the U1, the very moment that product is released. Until then, we’re left with a paragraph on Apple’s website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Apple‑designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness — allowing iPhone 11 Pro to understand its precise location relative to other nearby U1‑equipped Apple devices. It’s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it’s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing new capabilities, eh? The Apple marketing copy has it right—UWB’s technological trick is allowing devices to pinpoint one another’s locations in the real world with great precision. From raw data alone, UWB devices can detect locations within 10 centimeters (4 inches), but depending on implementation that accuracy can be lowered to as much as 5 millimeters, according to Mickael Viot, VP of marketing at UWB chipmaker Decawave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;securitythroughprecision&quot;&gt;Security through precision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sixcolors.com/images/content/2019/ios13-uwb-airdrop.jpg&quot;/&gt;For now, an improved AirDrop interface in iOS 13.1 is the only sign of Apple’s adoption of Ultra Wideband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology works by using a method that Apple’s already using in allowing Apple Watches to unlock Macs: using the total round-trip time of a radio signal (measured in nanoseconds—radio waves move at the speed of light) to calculate how far away a device is. This prevents your Apple Watch from unlocking a Mac unless it’s in close proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important security feature, because other wireless technologies such as Bluetooth tend to estimate distance by measuring the strength of a wireless signal, not the time it takes for it to be sent to a device and then returned back to the sender. Sneaky people could relay a signal and boost its power and fool a Bluetooth device into thinking you were nearby when you weren’t. That’s a security hole wide enough to break into a Mac or steal a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of light and a roundtrip signal allows for a precise measuring of distance, but UWB can also determine the angle of arrival of the radio signals by measuring the phase shift that comes when receiving the signal from multiple antennas. Put the distance and angle together and you’ve got incredible precision—enough for, the rumors suggest, Apple to use an augmented-reality display to mark the precise location of another device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the only feature Apple has announced involving the U1 is a modified version of AirDrop that uses that precision location to determine if another iPhone 11 is close (and, believe it or not, if it’s pointing at your phone), and pops that device to the very top of your AirDrop interface. UWB can be used to transfer data at up to 27 megabits per second, which is faster than Bluetooth LE, but slower than Wi-Fi. I don’t know if Apple’s using UWB to do the data transfer or just using it for location finding and then switching to a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection for fast file transfers, which is what usually happens when using AirDrop between devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the possible applications of UWB go way beyond AirDrop and tracking tags. Decawave’s Viot says potential applications include smart home tech, augmented reality, mobile payments, the aforementioned keyless car entry, and even indoor navigation. (And it’s not a power hog, either—Viot says that Decawave’s latest UWB chip uses one-third of the power of a Bluetooth LE chip when in beacon mode, as a tracking tile would be.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of smart home tech, both security and functionality could be improved by devices knowing exactly where they are, and where the humans in the house are. (This is one reason why Viot thinks that Apple will add UWB support to the Apple Watch sooner rather than later: we aren’t always with our phones, but we bring our wrists with us wherever we go.) Imagine a whole-home audio system moving music playback through multiple rooms based on the location of an individual listener. Consider the peace of mind of knowing that your smart door lock won’t open unless you’re standing right in front of it—and can lock the moment it knows you’re inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality is also an enormous area of interest for Apple, and UWB can help there, too, by providing location precision for devices and accessories. And then there’s boring stuff like UWB-enabled badges that could unlock doors and even enable office buildings to provide “turn by turn” directions to their destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the stolen car thing—that seems to have been enough of a security hole to help spur car manufacturers to get off of Bluetooth LE and on to something more secure. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://carconnectivity.org/&quot;&gt;Car Connectivity Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, of which both Apple and Google are members, should enable UWB-enabled devices to replace car keyfobs securely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;appleisfirstoutofthegate&quot;&gt;Apple is first out of the gate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s only if most smartphones are UWB enabled. As of today, the total number of smartphones shipping with UWB onboard is zero. In fact the iPhone 11 family, when it arrives next week, will be the first consumer smartphones to support UWB. A glance at the various trade groups coalescing around this technology suggests that Google, Samsung, HTC, and other major players plan to get in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s huge,” Viot says, that Apple has taken this step. He likens the move to Apple adopting Wi-Fi in the first iBook, which was the push the technology needed to start rolling out everywhere. Apple might not be talking a lot about it now, but that U1 chip may be our first step into a world where all of our devices know where they are in relation to one another at a precision measured in millimeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications are enormous. As Apple’s innocuous final marketing sentence about the U1 reads, “that’s just the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
