<title>Over 100 PBS local stations start streaming on YouTube TV</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/over-100-pbs-local-stations-start-streaming-today-on-youtube-tv/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/over-100-pbs-local-stations-start-streaming-today-on-youtube-tv/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/about/blogs/news/pbs-partners-with-youtube-tv-secures-streaming-for-local-stations-across-the-nation/&quot;&gt;PBS announced&lt;/a&gt; it had secured for its member stations streaming agreements on YouTube’s live TV service, YouTube TV. Today, that deal goes live. PBS says more than 100 of its local stations are now available on YouTube TV by way of dedicated live channels for both PBS and PBS Kids, as well through on-demand programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More stations are expected to be added in 2020, PBS notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBS service is available to 75% of U.S. households via YouTube TV, significantly broadening PBS’ reach among cord-cutters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before today, PBS programming has been available through the PBS.org and PBSKids.org websites, as well as the PBS Video app and PBS Kids app for iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung TV and Chromecast. Some of its programming has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.pbs.org/support/solutions/articles/12000060278-watching-pbs-videos-on-other-streaming-services-&quot;&gt;available on-demand&lt;/a&gt; via channels offered by Amazon and Apple, as well as through popular on-demand streaming services like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, U.S. households can also pick up their local PBS station’s signal for free via their digital antenna, or subscribe to cable or satellite TV to access PBS channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But YouTube TV is the first live TV service to offer PBS stations directly in its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership brings live and on-demand content, including the stations’ locally produced shows and PBS favorites, like “American Experience,” “Antiques Roadshow,” “Frontline,” “Great Performances,” “Masterpiece,” “Nature” and others. The kids’ stations, meanwhile, offer shows like “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” “Molly of Denali,” “Odd Squad,” “Pinkalicious &amp;amp; Peterrific,” “Wild Kratts” and “Sesame Street.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting, however, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://deadline.com/2019/10/sesame-street-hbo-max-deal-move-from-hbo-5-year-sesame-workshop-full-library-new-series-specials-spinoffs-1202750909/&quot;&gt;it’s HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, not PBS, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/sesame-street-hbo-max.html&quot;&gt;will be the new streaming home&lt;/a&gt; to first-run “Sesame Street” episodes starting in 2020. PBS gets them at some later point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1925228&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;354&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png 3300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png?resize=768,399 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png?resize=1536,799 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png?resize=2048,1065 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pbs-on-ytv.png?resize=50,26 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every year, more and more households are seeking alternative ways to view their favorite PBS programs,” said PBS Chief Digital and Marketing Officer Ira Rubenstein, in a statement. “PBS is committed to making trusted content available to all households across as many platforms as possible. We are pleased that YouTube TV recognizes public television’s unique structure and worked with us to provide our viewers with more ways to watch the programs that they love through their local PBS station.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not likely that losing access to PBS has stopped many people from cutting the cord, the way that the lack of live sports has, in years past. In fact, today’s streaming services like Prime Video and Netflix offer a range of “PBS-like” content, including educational kids’ shows, nature documentaries, musical performances, news, history and more. But the addition will make it easier to access PBS for cord-cutters who prefer to watch TV through streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to partner with PBS on this unique partnership to further our commitment to providing a best-in-class experience for our users,” said Lori Conkling, global head of Partnerships at YouTube TV. “PBS and PBS Kids are highly requested channels by our users, and we’re thrilled to be able to add these to the YouTube TV lineup starting today,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Story of Mattermost: Open-Sourced Competitor to Slack</title>
<link>https://breakoutstartups.substack.com/p/breakout-startups-23-mattermost</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://breakoutstartups.substack.com/p/breakout-startups-23-mattermost</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ankitkr0&quot;&gt;Ankit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 23rd Edition of Breakout Startups, we are covering &lt;strong&gt;Mattermost&lt;/strong&gt;, the company building an open-sourced competitor to Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d3e1449-ce56-413a-b831-148045cf632f_533x315.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d3e1449-ce56-413a-b831-148045cf632f_533x315.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5d3e1449-ce56-413a-b831-148045cf632f_533x315.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:315,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:533,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;About&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattermost builds open-source and high-trust messaging tools for enterprises and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was founded in 2011 as &lt;strong&gt;“SpinPunch, Inc”&lt;/strong&gt;, an HTML5 game engine developer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product was initially supposed to be used as a communication tool within Spinpunch’s gaming portal. At the same time, the company was building the messaging software, there was growing frustration with the messaging app used internally by employees. Instead, the team decided to repurpose the code used for its game portal messaging app and create a business-focused team chat app that the team can use for itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, the company open-sourced the tool in 2015. And the rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattermost is an Open-Core Company, a business strategy where a company offers a “core” version of a product with limited features as free and open-source (FOSS) software at the same time an add-on commercial version is released as proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mattermost offers two separate commercial versions:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private-cloud workspace solution designed for deployment by non-technical users with necessary IT skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With apps for your desktop and mobile devices, this solution brings team communication into a single environment, with instant search, continuous archiving, and a bunch of third-party integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything from the Team version with a little extra focus on large enterprises. This version comes with advanced security, higher-grade messaging, and a bunch of scalability tools for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mattermost Vs Others&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattermost has been able to carve out space in the market for itself because of its highly unique features. Let’s deep dive in a few of them 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Sourced Product and Highly Customizable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattermost is 100% Open Sourced. In fact, the team has been marketing itself as a free alternative to paid clients such as Slack, Hipchat, MS Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool easily integrates with existing applications and build new workflows especially operations and DevOps which serve as a core differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Snapshot from the Mattermost’s Home Page 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;image-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1250b40d-6636-431b-97e3-f170464e8c2b_533x445.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1250b40d-6636-431b-97e3-f170464e8c2b_533x445.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1250b40d-6636-431b-97e3-f170464e8c2b_533x445.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:445,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:533,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can check the Product here 👇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp&quot; title=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp&quot;&gt;mattermost/mattermost-webapp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp&quot; title=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp&quot; title=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp&quot;&gt;Mattermost is an open-source, self-hosted Slack-alternative from https://mattermost.org. It’s written in Golang and…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp&quot; title=&quot;https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp&quot;&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Security Conscious Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more differentiating factor for Mattermost is its extra special focus security. The product offers the industry’s most flexible and secure instant messaging capabilities across all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any company can customize Mattermost to eliminate shadow IT and ensure compliance with the unique regional, industry-specific and company-specific requirements facing a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The products work very effectively at scale as well. Uber built out its own version of Mattermost, &lt;strong&gt;uChat&lt;/strong&gt;, after its previous chat client started crashing that crippled the company’s ability to effectively communicate online. That’s what led the company to explore Mattermost to built out its own solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/uchat/&quot; title=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/uchat/&quot;&gt;The Road to uChat: Building Uber's Internal Chat Solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/uchat/&quot; title=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/uchat/&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/uchat/&quot; title=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/uchat/&quot;&gt;Learn how Uber Engineering's Employee Productivity Tools team built uChat, an internal chat solution capable of scaling…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/uchat/&quot; title=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/uchat/&quot;&gt;eng.uber.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Strong Developer Niche&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product has been able to crack a strong niche among the developer community. Given its highly customizable features and an extra focus on DevOps, the product remains an outright favorite of the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tweet&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/Jayfish/status/1187447285468164096?s=20&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;full_text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Just tried &amp;lt;span class=\&amp;quot;tweet-fake-link\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;@Mattermost&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;, a &amp;lt;span class=\&amp;quot;tweet-fake-link\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;#OpenSource&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; alternative to &amp;lt;span class=\&amp;quot;tweet-fake-link\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;@SlackHQ&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; It's pretty slick&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Jayfish&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Jay Nichols&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;date&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Thu Oct 24 19:14:29 +0000 2019&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;photos&amp;quot;:[],&amp;quot;quoted_tweet&amp;quot;:{},&amp;quot;retweet_count&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;like_count&amp;quot;:2,&amp;quot;expanded_url&amp;quot;:{}}&quot;&gt;

Just tried &lt;span class=&quot;tweet-fake-link&quot;&gt;@Mattermost&lt;/span&gt;, a &lt;span class=&quot;tweet-fake-link&quot;&gt;#OpenSource&lt;/span&gt; alternative to &lt;span class=&quot;tweet-fake-link&quot;&gt;@SlackHQ&lt;/span&gt; It's pretty slick

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Rapid Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattermost has been recording phenomenal growth in 2019 which makes its one of the breakout companies of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s Founder and CEO, Ian Tien, wrote in a blog,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every open source Mattermost server can support&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hundreds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;of Slack-compatible teams and every month over 10,000 servers are downloaded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this rapid growth, there is a great room for development as the estimated market size for chat client stands at $30B right now. He says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Slack’s S-1 they estimate our market opportunity at around $30B, which is more than enough room for Mattermost, Slack and Microsoft Teams to serve the different market segments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Funding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeing an increased interested in investors willing to back open core companies. After &lt;strong&gt;GitLab&lt;/strong&gt; achieved the Unicorn valuation earlier this year, Mattermost became one of the few companies to have raised two later-stage rounds of financing within a single year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, Mattermost has raised a total of $70M in funding over 3 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s latest funding round Series B of $50M was led by &lt;strong&gt;YC Continuity Fund&lt;/strong&gt;. This was the company’s second funding round in the same year after it raised $20M Series A led by &lt;strong&gt;RedPoint Ventures&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, the company had raised a Seed Round in 2017 from &lt;strong&gt;S28 Capital&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ali Rowghani&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CEO&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Y Combinator Continuity&lt;/strong&gt;, talking about the investment in &lt;strong&gt;Mattermost&lt;/strong&gt; says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is YC’s largest investment in an open source company. We believe that open source will drive innovation in enterprise messaging and collaboration just as it has for the infrastructure stack that powers many of the world’s largest companies”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattermost is in one of the most crowded markets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mattermost&lt;/strong&gt; is operating in a market that is highly competitive with much larger players such as &lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;MicrosoftTeams&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Hipchat&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Twist&lt;/strong&gt;, already having a strong footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; became the client with the biggest number of users surpassing &lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even in this, highly competitive market, Mattermost has been able to able to find a strong niche in the community of developers and teams looking for a customized official chat client for internal collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This traction led to the company raising a &lt;strong&gt;$50 Million Series B(it’s second funding round in an year) funding round led by the YC Continuity Fund&lt;/strong&gt; to further accelerate the development of its products. The team had earlier raised a $20M Series A funding round led by RedPoint Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Brass Set 2023 as Deadline to Beat Amazon, Microsoft in Cloud</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;At the time, Diane Greene, the co-founder of VMware and a Google board member, was running Google Cloud. Greene took the helm in late 2015, and after two years, she had had little luck in making the unit a bigger player in the business—it remained a distant No. 3 behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Google’s troubles adapting to selling enterprise software—a business that was far afield from its main source of revenue, online advertising—were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tough-climb-google-cloud-revenue-aws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt;. Being third in the cloud market was “unacceptable” to Page and the team, the same person said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Alphabet, Google’s cloud business represents a large new source of potential revenue outside its ads business, something the company has sought to establish for years to no avail. Last quarter, nearly all of the company’s $40.5 billion in revenue came from advertising. Meanwhile, a collection of newer businesses that Alphabet lumps together as “other bets” in its financial statements, including the self-driving car unit Waymo, generated a mere $155 million in revenue while incurring operating losses of nearly $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google discussions echo debates that many other technology companies have had about the viability of businesses when one or two much larger rivals overshadow them. In 2009, Yahoo and Microsoft formed an alliance in internet search because they didn’t believe they were big enough on their own to achieve the scale necessary to deliver attractive profits. Even after banding together, the two weren’t able to dislodge Google from its supremacy in internet search.        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Google executives decided in the spring of 2018 that the cloud computing opportunity was simply too big to give up on. Because cloud services are attempting to steal spending from existing forms of technology spending, the executives viewed Google Cloud as having a greater chance of success than some of the more experimental Alphabet businesses, this person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesperson declined to comment prior to the publication of this story, but after it appeared released the following statement: &quot;Reports of these conversations from 2018 are simply not accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late summer of 2018, shortly before Greene stepped down as Google Cloud CEO and was succeeded by Oracle veteran Thomas Kurian, executives told staffers in the group that they had decided on a five-year, $20 billion budget for capital expenditures—the equipment, facilities, and other goods necessary to keep the business running—that would include financing for new data centers to help Google Cloud expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what Prabhakar Raghavan, the head of Google Cloud’s G Suite unit—which sells productivity apps like Gmail and Docs to businesses—told his leadership team in a biannual planning meeting in the late summer of 2018, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person said the group’s leaders didn’t explicitly state what would happen to the cloud division if it didn’t reach a top two position by 2023. A commonly held view inside the group was that Google wouldn’t continue investing money if it failed to it meet its goal, the person said. The group’s leaders told staffers that if Google couldn’t reach a certain size with its computing and storage business—two of the most commonly used cloud services—the cloud unit might never become profitable, the person said. To reach such scale, they said, Google would need to be in a top two position in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Insider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/google-cloud-thomas-kurian-salespeople-compensation-oracle-sap-2019-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; the five-year goal for the cloud division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reaching for the Clouds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming No. 1 or 2 in the cloud market will be a stretch for Google. In the third quarter, Amazon Web Services accounted for almost 33% of global cloud spending, while Microsoft had nearly 17% and Google had just under 7%, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-Q3-2019&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according to research firm Canalys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are some signs of progress. On Alphabet’s fiscal second quarter earnings call in July, Pichai revealed that Google Cloud generated $2 billion in revenue during the quarter, giving it an $8 billion annualized sales rate—double the $1 billion a quarter in cloud revenue it disclosed for the last quarter of 2017 (Pichai was also recently named Alphabet CEO, replacing Page). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those figures also included revenue from G Suite, its collection of online productivity apps for businesses such as Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Sheets, which made it difficult for outsiders to see how big its cloud business was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, though, revenues from Google Cloud Platform—which includes simple services like computing and storage and advanced ones like data analytics and artificial intelligence—exceed those from G Suite and are growing at a faster rate, according to three former employees familiar with the matter. Google Cloud hasn’t publicly revealed how much of its business comes from cloud services and applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift in the balance of its business could help Google build more-strategic long-term relationships with Fortune 500 firms and other companies, because once customers move their data into Google Cloud, they often adopt additional cloud services, according to multiple former employees. Among Google’s current marquee customers are the music-streaming service Spotify and the social media company Snap.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, to reach the 2023 goal, Kurian, who’s been on the job for less than a year, will need to move quickly. Amazon Web Services was on an annualized sales rate of $36 billion at the end of its parent company’s fiscal third quarter in September—more than four times that of Google earlier in the year. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue for Azure, its comparable cloud business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s cloud business didn’t start receiving significant internal support and resources until 2014, when the group held its first customer conference. At the event and in later interviews, Urs Hölzle, Google’s senior vice president of technical infrastructure, predicted that the company’s cloud business would eventually generate more revenue that its lucrative digital advertising unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hölzle’s prediction now seems far-fetched. Last year, Alphabet brought in over $116 billion in advertising revenue. And Google Cloud is far from reaching the rallying cry that former CEO Diane Greene issued shortly before her departure, setting a goal for Cloud to hit a $20 billion run rate by the end of 2020, a target that multiple former employees confirmed. The Information couldn’t learn whether Kurian has mentioned the $20 billion by 2020 goal since taking over the division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfamiliar Terrain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of Google co-founder Page, getting into the cloud business was a big leap. He never wanted Google to be a traditional enterprise software company with big direct-sales teams, splashy marketing, and long sales cycles, said people who have worked with him. After seeing limited progress in the first six years of the project, he had a nagging question—which still remains—of what exactly Google Cloud would provide for customers that they couldn’t get from AWS and Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate inside Alphabet about the future of Google Cloud ended around the spring of 2018 with a new determination to go after what was clearly a big opportunity, one that with different leadership could result in a much more meaningful business for Alphabet, said the person with direct knowledge of the discussions. At the time, the unit was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/behind-google-cloud-chiefs-departure-tensions-with-execs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;roiled internally by a conflict&lt;/a&gt; between Greene, the Google Cloud CEO at the time, and a senior sales executive she had recently hired from Intel, Diane Bryant, as Google Cloud’s chief operating officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company embarked on a search for the next leader of the cloud business, ending months later with the hiring of Kurian. Bryant declined to comment for this story. Greene didn’t respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure to show more progress very soon in the business extends to Google Cloud product teams, which the company is now asking to develop detailed multiyear strategic plans, a former Google Cloud employee said. This is a departure from the past, when product teams would only plan ahead about 18 months, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurian has already made changes to Google Cloud’s “internet of things” group, which develops software for managing connected devices. Greene had previously made big investments in the group, hiring former Samsung chief technology officer Injong Rhee to lead it and giving him a team of about 20 directors and product managers, said the person who has worked at Google Cloud. But the internet of things unit didn’t generate much business, prompting Kurian to move dozens of engineers out of that unit and into Google Cloud’s machine learning group, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud’s database teams have also been under the microscope for not shipping products and features quickly enough, and also for not following up with customers after deals close to make sure they’re getting business value from products, said the person who has worked at Google Cloud. These teams have been told they have until 2023 to improve, or Google Cloud may shift its priorities away from developing its database services in favor of selling them through partnerships with third-party providers, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s growth goals for its cloud platform business have also had an impact on its apps division. A person directly familiar with the matter told The Information that the company halted new engineering hires for G Suite in 2019. Instead, Google shifted headcount growth to its cloud platform sales and engineering teams. (The company said in mid-2019 that the sales force for its cloud division would triple in size over the next three years.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That and other changes rattled the department, the person said. Leaders in the group began departing, including vice president of engineering Garrick Toubassi and vice president of user experience Amy Lokey, both of whom exited Google altogether. The division’s head, Prabhakar Raghavan, became the head of ads in October 2018. In August, the company announced it would be shutting down Google Hire, which levered G Suite apps, like Gmail and Calendar, to help recruiters manage their pipeline of candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;last-paragraph&quot;&gt;Another person said the strife within the G Suite organization may settle down with the recent appointment of Javier Soltero, who joined in October as the new head of the department. The hiring of Soltero, a respected entrepreneur who previously led Microsoft Outlook and Cortana, its voice assistant product, could arguably indicate Kurian’s commitment to the G Suite business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;addendum&quot;&gt;This story has been updated with a statement from a Google spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about anyone can open a store on Amazon.com and sell just about anything. Just ask the dumpster divers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are among the dedicated cadre of sellers on Amazon who say they sort through other people’s rejects, including directly from the trash, clean them up and list them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/AMZN&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Inc.&lt;/span&gt; ’s platform. Many post their hunting accounts on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are an elusive lot. Many The Wall Street Journal contacted wouldn’t give details about their listings, said they stopped selling dumpster finds or no longer listed them as new, didn’t respond to inquiries or stopped communicating. Some said they feared Amazon would close their stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Journal set out to test whether these claims were true. Reporters went dumpster diving in several New Jersey towns and retrieved dozens of discards from the trash including a stencil set, scrapbook paper and a sealed jar of Trader Joe’s lemon curd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journal set up a store on Amazon to see if it could list some of its salvaged goods for sale as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-layout=&quot;bleed&quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; media-object type-InsetDynamic bleed scope-web|mobileapps article__inset article__inset--type-InsetDynamic article__inset--bleed&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dynamic-inset-container article__inset__dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s stated rules didn’t explicitly prohibit items salvaged from the trash when the Journal disclosed the existence of its store to the company last month. The rules required that most goods be new and noted that sellers could offer used books and electronics, among other things, if they identified them as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sellers are responsible for meeting Amazon’s high bar for product quality,” an Amazon spokeswoman said. Examples the Journal presented to Amazon of dumpster-sourced listings “are isolated incidents,” she said. “We are investigating and will take appropriate action against the bad actors involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She declined to comment on the Journal’s store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last week, Amazon said it updated its policy to explicitly prohibit selling items taken from the trash, adding to its list of unacceptable items any “intended for destruction or disposal or otherwise designated as unsellable by the manufacturer or a supplier, vendor, or retailer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Control issues&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon exerts limited control over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-amazon-needs-others-to-keep-selling-11555002984?mod=article_inline&amp;amp;mod=article_inline&amp;amp;mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;its third-party marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, which connects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-heavy-recruitment-of-chinese-sellers-puts-consumers-at-risk-11573489075?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;buyers with millions of merchants around the world&lt;/a&gt;. The company has said it isn’t liable for what these merchants sell, saying in court cases Amazon itself isn’t the one selling the products listed by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had an internal saying: Unless the product’s on fire when we receive it, we would accept anything,” said James Thomson, who helped oversee the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-amazons-shipping-empire-is-challenging-ups-and-fedex-11567071003?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Fulfillment By Amazon program—under which Amazon handles logistics for third-party sellers&lt;/a&gt;—before leaving in 2013. He is now a consultant to brands with Amazon accounts. In his view, he said, “Ultimately consumers are the police of the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;djai2html-headline&quot;&gt;New or Not?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;djai2html-leadin&quot;&gt;Besides the millions of brand-new items sold on Amazon's website, some labeled 'new' may be someone's rejects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-2&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A store throws out items in a commercial dumpster, which is searched by a dumpster diver…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-3&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-4&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and lists them as new on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon spokeswoman said Mr. Thomson’s “statements are demonstrably false.” Mr. Thomson said he stood by his assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wade Coggins, near Beaverton, Ore., said he finds items to sell on Amazon and eBay in store clearance sections, abandoned storage units and dumpsters. He said he has salvaged cardboard boxes, bubble wrap and peanuts from trash bins to package his orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blemishes need to be cleaned off, he said, adding that some people shrink-wrap items to make them look more legitimate. “When you send stuff in to Amazon,” he said, “it needs to look brand new.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Coggins identified one Amazon store and said he had another that he declined to disclose. The Amazon spokeswoman said the company couldn’t find evidence of a second store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To list items under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-prime-has-more-than-100-million-members-1524088630?mod=article_inline&amp;amp;mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Amazon Prime—the subscription service offering quick, free delivery&lt;/a&gt;—third-party sellers send them to an Amazon warehouse where the retailer handles packaging, delivery and returns.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon merchant David Gracy, 49, who among other things resells new merchandise purchased from stores and brand closeouts, said his business partner in 2016 salvaged items from dumpsters including a batch of humidifiers and keyboards in Austin, Texas. Mr. Gracy’s Amazon store sold such items for more than a year under Amazon Prime, he said. He said he hasn’t sold dumpster finds since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he wouldn’t be comfortable selling certain salvaged items, such as food, on the site, but “Amazon’s not going to ask ‘Where’d you get it from? Did you get it from a dumpster?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;‘DJ Co’ opens shop&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said it requires sellers to provide government-issued identification and uses a “system that analyzes hundreds of unique data points to identify potential risk” and “we proactively block suspicious businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle0&quot;&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-2&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person returns an item to a retail store or Amazon…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-3&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…who sells the item back on Amazon as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journal applied to open an Amazon store in September by submitting a reporter’s driver’s license and bank statement. Two days later, “DJ Co” was open for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email arrived declaring: “Welcome to Fulfillment by Amazon.” The Journal signed up for a $39.99-a-month account and paid additional fees, such as for storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late one night several days before the store opened, reporters with flashlights and blue latex gloves visited Clifton, Clark and Paramus, N.J., scouring dumpsters behind outlets such as a Michaels craft store and a Trader Joe’s grocery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bins were a humid mess of broken glass and smashed boxes, a stench of rot in the air. Several products were in original packaging, some soiled with coffee grounds, moldy blackberries or juice from a bag of chicken thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among items the reporters retrieved were a stencil set, a sheet of scrapbook paper and the lemon curd. The curd jar showed an expiration date of May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journal cleaned and packed the three items—bubble-wrapping and taping the curd jar—and mailed them to an Amazon warehouse in Pennsylvania in September and October. The Journal completed Amazon’s documentation requirements by specifying the items’ universal product codes, the numbers next to bar codes on most products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon didn’t ask about the inventory’s origins or sell-by dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journal’s dumpster finds were soon up for sale with an Amazon Prime logo, available to millions of shoppers, including the listing for “Trader Joe’s Imported English Authentic Lemon Curd 10.5oz” at $12.00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-caption-content&quot;&gt;Products the Journal found in dumpsters, listed on ‘DJ Co’ on Amazon and sent to an Amazon warehouse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a later dumpster dive, the Journal was able to go through almost all of the listing process with salvaged breath mints, sunflower seeds, marmalade, crispbread, fig fruit butter, olives, a headband and a Halloween mask—stopping just short of shipping them to the Amazon warehouse, which is required for an item to appear for purchase on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To list a sunscreen lotion, Amazon asked for a safety-data sheet. Attempts to list a protein powder, a pea-powder dietary supplement and a face sheet mask—all from the dive—elicited a request from Amazon for proof of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Trader Joe’s spokeswoman, Kenya Friend-Daniel, said the grocer doesn’t approve of its products’ sale on Amazon and that its policy is to discard an item only if it isn’t fit for sale. Michaels spokeswoman Mallory Smith said: “We do not approve of the sale of Michaels products by unauthorized third party sellers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;‘Broken things’&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon uses warehouse workers to identify problematic products, and computers direct workers to make spot checks. Some former employees said the daily volume is often too large to handle, with workers charged with scanning sometimes hundreds of items an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I myself ignored broken things more often than not,” said Chris Grantham, who held several roles in Amazon’s fulfillment center in Ruskin, Fla., until 2017, including quality-assurance inspector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-2&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone donates an unused item to a thrift shop…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-4&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and then lists the item as new on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon urged speed over precision, penalizing workers who didn’t hit productivity requirements, he said. Workers sometimes changed expiration dates for expired products in the computer, he said, so they wouldn’t be expected to perform a complicated disposal process—a shortcut noted by several warehouse employees in a discussion reviewed by the Journal in a restricted &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/FB&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; group for Amazon workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon spokeswoman said workers have the authority to sideline unacceptable products and that Amazon employs “multiple checks and balances in the inventory and picking process to ensure quality control standards are upheld.” Regarding worker-productivity requirements, she said “performance is measured and evaluated over a long period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Durfee said he has used Amazon to sell toys, videogames, electronics and trinkets from dumpsters including bins behind Michaels and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/GME&quot;&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; stores. The 26-year-old in Torrington, Conn., said one of his favorite places to find things to list on Amazon is his town dump. He said he lists his dumpster finds as used and declined to identify his storefront, saying he fears other sellers might try to sabotage him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-caption-content&quot;&gt;‘I started with dumpster diving because I had no money to buy inventory,’ says Mr. Durfee, here on Amazon’s site last month.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-credit article__inset__image__caption__credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-credit-tag&quot;&gt;Photo:&lt;/span&gt; Bryan Anselm for The Wall Street Journal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2017 YouTube video, he tests out television remote controls he said he found in a dumpster and tells viewers they can wash off corroded battery compartments with baking soda and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he opened his Amazon store six years ago after realizing it was more lucrative to resell inventory than work as a photographer. “I started with dumpster diving because I had no money to buy inventory,” he said, and branched into buying at thrift stores and discount-store clearance sections for items to sell on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should Amazon be allowed to let just about anyone sell just about anything on its platform?&lt;/em&gt; Join the conversation below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll go to pawnshops, I’ll go dumpster diving,” he said. “I’m one of those people who does everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Negative comments&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sellers on Amazon’s internal discussion boards have voiced concerns about garbage showing up on the site. One, in a post titled “Dumpster Divers Overrunning Beauty Category,” wrote of items in bad condition that resulted in complaints directed at the poster and other sellers in the category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon spokeswoman said the seller’s characterization of the category as being overrun “is wrong and baseless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; media-object type-InsetRichText wrap scope-web|mobileapps article__inset article__inset--type-InsetRichText article__inset--wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if Amazon customers shared such concerns, the Journal analyzed about 45,000 comments posted on Amazon in 2018 and 2019. It found nearly 8,400 comments on 4,300 listings for foods, makeup and over-the-counter medications with keywords suggesting they were unsealed, expired, moldy, unnaturally sticky or problematic in some other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 544 of the 4,300 products were promoted as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-just-buy-now-when-shopping-on-amazon-you-need-to-pay-attention-11553592600?mod=article_inline&amp;amp;mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Amazon’s Choice, which many consumers take to be the company’s endorsement.&lt;/a&gt; Amazon’s website says the label reflects a combination of factors such as ratings, pricing and shipping time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 4,300 listing the Journal reviewed, 241—including generic ibuprofen, Sun Chips and an Amazon’s Choice face lotion—had at least five reviews from different customers suggesting the item was used or expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reviewer said lipstick arrived with no packaging, marred and mildewed. Five reviewers said they received a protein bar sprouting white fungus, one writing: “My daughter has eaten a handful of them and called me into the kitchen today to show me that there was MOLD on the bar she had eaten half of!!!!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Eileen Anastassopoulos bought her son’s favorite grape-flavored applesauce from an Amazon third-party seller, she told the Journal. The squeezable packets had expired seven months before, said the 39-year-old mother, who left a review with a photo showing its November 2017 “best before” date to warn others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle0&quot;&gt;Scenario 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-2&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person returns an item to an Amazon warehouse…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-3&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…where a worker determines that it can be resold. The item is mixed in with inventory…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai1-5&quot; class=&quot;g-GFX g-aiAbs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and sent to another Amazon customer as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon sent a new shipment after she complained, she said, but “if I wasn’t a diligent person checking expiration dates I could have had an issue with my son.” The Journal couldn’t identify her seller but did find another seller of the same applesauce that received recent reviews alleging the sale of expired or damaged products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon spokeswoman said the company investigates product reviews and takes corrective actions as needed. Of those the Journal identified, she said, “the product reviews where customers expressed issues with quality represents less than 0.01% of orders on those products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said Amazon uses “a combination of artificial intelligence and manual systems to monitor for product quality and safety concerns in our store” and that if a product fails its guidelines, Amazon will “take appropriate action against the seller, which may include removal of their account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon customers don’t always have total control over whom they buy from. A default setting in an Amazon account known as “commingling” can mean customers think they are buying from one merchant but end up getting the product from another—if, say, another seller’s product is in a warehouse closer to the buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spokeswoman said the process “allows Amazon to efficiently process, fulfill, and ship customer orders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Returns for sale&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One class of third-party Amazon merchants buys inventory from liquidation companies, which sell bathtub-sized cardboard boxes on pallets full of products typically removed from big retailers’ shelves or warehouses, or full of returned goods. The products often arrive in the boxes uninspected and piled loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather Hooks, 40, said she has sold thousands of goods on Amazon from liquidators, mostly returns such as Lego sets, Tylenol pills, Hanes undergarments and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/LRLCY&quot;&gt;Maybelline&lt;/a&gt; makeup. She estimated that about 75% of the products she buys out of liquidation are flawless and said she sells those on Amazon as new. The rest she sells on eBay and other sites, she said, labeling their condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers say eBay has fewer restrictions on what can be listed as used. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/EBAY&quot;&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Inc.&lt;/span&gt; spokesperson said the site requires sellers to describe listings accurately, including whether items are used or damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Hooks, who lives near St. Louis, said she makes more than $20,000 a year on Amazon selling this way and profits from a YouTube account, where she chronicles her business. Her storefront boasts hundreds of items, including toys, candy, toiletries, makeup and clothes. Amazon temporarily banned her from selling about three years ago, she said, because a brand complained she was listing its product as an unauthorized seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m extremely picky now,” she said, saying she inspects each product to see if seals are broken or parts are missing. “Even if it has a ding on the box, I won’t send it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of dumpster diving, she said: “That’s not my scene,” but “some people think liquidation is a little bit like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Amazon’s internal discussion board, one seller complained Amazon itself was reselling returned goods. This seller, who lists earrings, wrote in a May 2018 post that Amazon said it sometimes repackages products that customers have returned and mixes them back with inventory if warehouse workers approve. This merchant wrote of asking Amazon to stop reselling the merchant’s returned earrings but said the company justified it by saying the items were inspected at the warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amazon spokeswoman said the company subjects all returns to a rigorous inspection “and all items reintroduced to inventory as new meet the same high standards as what a vendor or seller sends us directly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Amazon sellers said they buy discarded Amazon returns from liquidators and then relist them on Amazon. Amazon said it works with liquidators and that items complying with its policies are allowed for sale on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;The lemon curd&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three dumpster finds the Journal sent to the Amazon warehouse stayed on the DJ Co store for only a few seconds—the Journal immediately bought them so nobody else could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All came back with a return address of an Amazon warehouse in Kentucky. The stencil set was bent. The paper arrived in good condition. Both arrived in Amazon packaging, not the packaging in which the Journal sent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trader Joe’s lemon curd came back in the box the Journal packaged it in to send to Amazon, still in the same bubble wrap and tape. The only thing Amazon appeared to have done was to affix its own shipping label atop the Journal’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ Co remained open until late last week, though not stocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Amazon said it updated its policy to ban items from the trash. The spokeswoman said: “Sourcing items from the trash has always been inconsistent with Amazon’s high expectations of its sellers and prohibited by the Seller Code of Conduct on Amazon, which requires that sellers act fairly and honestly. We’ve updated our policy to more explicitly prohibit this type of behavior.” Asked how it will enforce the new rule, Amazon said it expanded its existing verification efforts, including increased documentation spot checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the Journal received an email from Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your account has been closed due to violations of our Seller Policies and Seller Code of Conduct. Specifically, we have learned that your have offered products that were sourced in a manner that does not meet Amazon’s high bar for customer trust and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>23andMe to share customer gene data with GlaxoSmithKline for $300M</title>
<link>https://www.tomsguide.com/us/23andme-gsk-dna-data-deal,news-27685.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tomsguide.com/us/23andme-gsk-dna-data-deal,news-27685.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Home-DNA-test provider 23andMe will provide the genetic information of its 5 million customers to pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for a reported $300 million investment, alarming privacy advocates and bioethicists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Credit: Connect World/Shutterstock&quot; class=&quot;pull- lazy-image lazy-image-loading lazyload optional-image&quot; onerror=&quot;if(this.src &amp;amp;&amp;amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)&quot; sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-normal=&quot;https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomsguide/media/img/missing-image.svg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DX3Nh7J46ogAZEcGqBpfXG-320-80.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DX3Nh7J46ogAZEcGqBpfXG-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DX3Nh7J46ogAZEcGqBpfXG-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DX3Nh7J46ogAZEcGqBpfXG-970-80.jpg 970w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-original-mos=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DX3Nh7J46ogAZEcGqBpfXG.jpg&quot; data-pin-media=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DX3Nh7J46ogAZEcGqBpfXG.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Connect World/Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hear regularly from customers that they want to be part of a solution that is improving health care,&quot; 23andMe CEO Anne Wojicki said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.23andme.com/news/a-note-on-23andmes-new-collaboration-with-gsk/&quot;&gt;a blog post announcing the news&lt;/a&gt; yesterday (July 25). &quot;By working with GSK, we believe we will accelerate the development of breakthroughs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;hawk-widget&quot; data-render-type=&quot;fte&quot; data-widget-type=&quot;seasonal&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;23andMe charges $99 for an &quot;Ancestry&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/62690-how-dna-ancestry-23andme-tests-work.html&quot;&gt;DNA test&lt;/a&gt; that gathers genealogical information, and $199 for a combined &quot;Health and Ancestry&quot; test that adds screening for genetically transmitted diseases. (Both are currently discounted by 30 percent on the 23andMe website.) Customers spit into a test tube and mail it to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wojcicki stressed that all customers involved had agreed to let their DNA be used for medical research when they signed up for the tests. But 23andMe would essentially be making $60 from each paying customer with the GSK deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The problem with a lot of these privacy policies and Terms of Service is that no one really reads them,&quot; Tiffany C. Li, a privacy expert and resident fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project, told Tom's Guide. &quot;You are paying to help the company make money with your data.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lose-it-helix-embodydna-tested,news-26193.html&quot;&gt;I Took a DNA Test to Shape Up, But It Didn't Work Out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li wasn't alone in bringing up the fact that 23andMe was making money from both ends of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are they going to offer rebates to people who opt in so their customers aren't paying for the privilege of 23andMe working with a for-profit company in a for-profit research project?&quot; Peter Pitts, head of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/drug-giant-glaxo-teams-dna-testing-company-23andme-n894531&quot;&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li has been raising alarms over such tests for some time. She co-wrote an opinion piece in life-sciences news site STAT in May &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/30/dna-donors-genetic-privacy-nih/&quot;&gt;urging DNA-test customers to demand greater genetic privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, she tweeted about the news that California police had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/62668-ethics-genealogy-websites-crime.html&quot;&gt;arrested a suspect in a decades-old serial-killer case based on publicly available genetic data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you give your DNA data to companies like Ancestry.com or 23andMe, you give up not only your own genetic privacy, but that of your entire family,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tiffanycli/status/989646127988445184&quot;&gt;Li said&lt;/a&gt;. (Neither company's tests were involved in the serial-killer case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Li said, we shouldn't be surprised that a DNA-testing firm's customer genetic data ends up in the hands of a pharmaceutical giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Big Pharma tie-in has happened before,&quot; Li told Tom's Guide, referring to the 2012 sale of DeCODE Genetics, which catalogued the DNA of almost half the population of Iceland, to drug maker Amgen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both NBC and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/07/25/23andme-gets-300-million-boost-from-glaxo-to-develop-new-drugs/#2c034b463213&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; reported that GSK will invest $300 million in 23andMe as part of the deal, which would likely be the largest single infusion of capital the company has received. The two will splits costs and profits related to any drugs that result from the partnership, which is slated to last four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23andMe was co-founded in 2006 by Wojcicki, who at the time was dating Google co-founder Sergey Brin. (They later married and divorced.) Google invested $3.9 million in 23andMe in 2007, alongside separate investments by Genentech and two venture-capital firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google was started in the Wojcicki family garage in Palo Alto, California, in 1998. Wojcicki's sister Esther became Google's marketing manager the following year and now runs Google subsidiary YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings on 23andMe are unavailable, as it's a privately held company, but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/23andme-hits-1-5b-pre-money-valuation-in-latest-huge-funding-round/&quot;&gt;valued at $1.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of 2017, following the FDA's long-delayed approval of 23andMe's &quot;Health and Ancestry&quot; test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forbes reported that the data-sharing agreement came about through new GSK Chief Scientific Officer Hal Barron's professional relationships with Wojcicki and with 23andMe executive Richard Scheller, who used with work with Barron at Genentech.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>LogMeIn Acquired by Private Equity</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/logmein-agrees-to-be-acquired-by-francisco-partners-and-evergreen-for-4-3b/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://LogMeIn.com&quot;&gt;LogMeIn&lt;/a&gt; announced this morning that it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.logmeininc.com/about-us/investors/news/press-release-details/2019/LogMeIn-Enters-into-Definitive-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-Affiliates-of-Francisco-Partners-and-Evergreen-Coast-Capital-for-8605-per-Share-in-Cash/default.aspx&quot;&gt;agreed to be sold for $4.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; to affiliates of Francisco Partners and &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/evergreen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;evergreen&quot;&gt;Evergreen&lt;/a&gt; Coast Capital Corporation, the private equity affiliate of Elliott Management Corporation. The purchase price comes out to $86.05 per share in an all-cash deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had a 52-week high of $96.87 per share and a low of $62.02. The purchase price represents a 25% premium on the closing share price on September 18th, which the company reports was the day media reports began to leak that the company was up for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Wagner, president and CEO at LogMeIn said in a statement that the price reflects the high value of the company and will give stockholders a meaningful return. As you would expect, he also was optimistic that the partnership with Francisco and Evergreen will help the company going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe our partnership with &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/francisco-partners&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;francisco-partners&quot;&gt;Francisco Partners&lt;/a&gt; and Evergreen will help put us in a position to deliver the operational benefits needed to achieve sustained growth over the long term,” Wagner said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the private equity firms, they are getting a broad portfolio of products, including unified communications and collaboration (UCC). LogMeIn &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/logmein-is-buying-jive-communications-for-up-to-357m-to-step-up-in-enterprise-unified-comms/&quot;&gt;bought Jive Communications&lt;/a&gt; for $357 million in 2018 to give it deeper penetration in the unified communications market. Its most well known product is probably GoToMeeting, which has had to compete with the likes of Zoom, WebEx, BlueJean, Google Hangouts and others in a crowded video conferencing space. The company bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/citrix-in-deal-to-merge-goto-meeting-business-with-logmein-1469564337&quot;&gt;GoToMeeting from Citrix&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 for $1.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a variety of other products, including remote access tools. It raised $30 million in venture funding, according to Crunchbase &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/logmein&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, before it went public in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close in mid 2020, but the company does have a 45-day go-shop provision, which means it can try to find a buyer that will offer a better price than this one. If it doesn’t, the deal will be subject to standard regulatory scrutiny before it closes next year.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Climbing the Wealth Ladder</title>

&lt;h2&gt;Why Affluence Increases in Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stairs_upward.jpg&quot;/&gt;Photo: Pixabay
&lt;p&gt;If I gave you $100, would that change your life?  What about $100,000?  How about $100 million?  Your answer will depend on many things including age, family situation, and your current net worth.  More importantly though, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you change your behavior after receiving such money can tell you a lot about your current financial standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewart Butterfield &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/633164558/slack-flickr-stewart-butterfield&quot;&gt;expanded on this idea&lt;/a&gt; when he discussed what he called the “Three Levels of Wealth.”  My colleague, Ben Carlson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2018/08/the-3-levels-of-wealth/&quot;&gt;beautifully summarized&lt;/a&gt; the three levels of wealth as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1. I’m not stressed out about debt:&lt;/strong&gt; People who no longer have to worry about their credit card debt or student loans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2. I don’t care what stuff costs in restaurants:&lt;/strong&gt; How much you spend on a particular meal isn’t impacted by your finances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3. I don’t care what a vacation costs:&lt;/strong&gt; People who don’t care how expensive the hotel is or which flight they go on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting about thinking about wealth in levels is that you realize that certain sums of money won’t necessarily improve your life in any noticeable way.  For example, for the average person at level two (above), an extra $10,000 probably wouldn’t move them to level three.  Frankly, $10,000 isn’t enough to free someone from considering the cost of lodging and transportation for the rest of their life.  However, that same $10,000 given to the average person at level one may get them to level two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perfectly illustrates how wealth is, and always will be, a &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; measure.  Or as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44&quot;&gt;Jay Z once proclaimed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s fifty grand to a mother****er like me?  Can you please remind me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While $50,000 may change your life, it wouldn’t even register for Jay.  But the question is: just how trivial was “fifty grand” to Jay Z at the time those lyrics were written (2011)?  If we use Jay Z’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2011/03/09/the-forbes-five-hip-hop-wealthiest-artists/&quot;&gt;estimated net worth of $450 million in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, this means that $50,000 represented 0.01% (1 basis point) of his fortune.  This data point might seem random, but &lt;strong&gt;0.01% is a good proxy for what constitutes a trivial amount of money for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; level of wealth&lt;/strong&gt;.  For example, if you had a net worth of $10,000, paying $1 more (or 0.01% more) for something shouldn’t affect your finances in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use this 0.01% threshold as a guide to then re-think Butterfield’s “Three Levels of Wealth” to include other lifestyle adjustments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1.  Paycheck-to-paycheck:&lt;/strong&gt;  You are conscious of every dollar you spend.  This includes people with crippling debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2.  Grocery freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; How much specific grocery items cost don’t impact your finances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3.  Restaurant freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; You eat what you want at restaurants regardless of the cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4.  Travel freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; You travel when you want, how you want, and stay where you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 5.  House freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; You can afford your dream home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 6.  Philanthropic freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; You can give away money that has a profound impact on others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the diversity of life circumstances, it can be difficult to put an exact dollar amount on each of the above wealth levels.  For example, a single 21 year-old with $1 million is very different than a 65 year-old retired couple with $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we use the 0.01% threshold as a guide, a working-age adult could use the following amounts to determine their wealth level (note: the x-axis is a log scale):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wealth_steps_plot_log_scale.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-6771&quot; src=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wealth_steps_plot_log_scale.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1771&quot; height=&quot;1417&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wealth_steps_plot_log_scale.jpeg 1771w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wealth_steps_plot_log_scale-300x240.jpeg 300w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wealth_steps_plot_log_scale-1024x819.jpeg 1024w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wealth_steps_plot_log_scale-768x614.jpeg 768w, https://ofdollarsanddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wealth_steps_plot_log_scale-1536x1229.jpeg 1536w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1771px) 100vw, 1771px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose these specific levels because, for each category, the marginal spending decision represents about 0.01% of the net worth level shown.  Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are at the grocery store and you are deciding whether to purchase a dozen eggs for $1.99 or a dozen &lt;em&gt;cage-free&lt;/em&gt; eggs for $2.99.  If your net worth was $1,000, this single choice (paying $1 extra for cage-free eggs) could have a slight impact on your finances as it would represent 0.1% of your total assets.  However, if you were worth $10,000 (or more) the decision to spend $1 more would likely be trivial to your finances since it represents less than 0.01% of your wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we can extend this thinking to more expensive spending categories as well.  For example, imagine you are in a restaurant where you are deciding between a burger for $15 and salmon for $25.  If your net worth &amp;gt; $100,000 then the $10 difference is trivial (&amp;lt;0.01% of net worth).  If you continue to scale this logic upward you will see that the marginal impact of &lt;em&gt;a single decision&lt;/em&gt; within each level of wealth could be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1.  Paycheck-to-paycheck:&lt;/strong&gt;  $0-$0.99 per decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2.  Grocery freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; $1-$9 per decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3.  Restaurant freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; $10-$99 per decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4.  Travel freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; $100-$999 per decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 5.  House freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; $1,000-$9,999 per decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 6.  Philanthropic freedom: &lt;/strong&gt; $10,000+ per decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you view wealth in this way, it looks more like steps than a smooth, ever-increasing line.  This is because most people in the same level of wealth consume in much the same way.  If you are in level 3, you don’t fly private and you only fly first class if you are lucky enough to get upgraded.  If you are in level 1, you rarely fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly though, &lt;strong&gt;the best way to climb the wealth ladder is to spend money according to your level.&lt;/strong&gt;  If you are in level 1 and you book a vacation without caring about the costs (level 4), then you won’t progress further up the ladder.  Until you have the money to spend frivolously within a level, you have to be strict about your spending in that level.  Get this right and you have a far better chance of progressing up the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I know what it feels like to go from level 1 when I graduated college to level 2 within a year or so of working to hitting level 3 only more recently.  Though today I might opt for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dollarsanddata/status/1200957225013063680?s=20&quot;&gt;a good ribeye&lt;/a&gt; when eating out, I will still move my schedule around to find the absolute cheapest direct flights when traveling home for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this year I booked red eyes back from California to NYC on Thanksgiving night and on Christmas night because they were so much less expensive than flying back on the weekends.  I am spending my money according to my level and this allows me to enjoy my life while continuing to grow my wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you might argue that you shouldn’t increase your consumption with your net worth, but I would counter that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; lifestyle creep can be highly rewarding in terms of maximizing your leisure time and long-term &lt;a href=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/how-to-spend-money/&quot;&gt;life satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;.  In other words, there is a lot more to life than saving money.  Live a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Steps Only Get Larger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for this blog post came out of a conversation I had with a friend who recently sold his company for seven figures.  Now that he is technically a millionaire, we got to discussing how much his life was going to change as a result.  Our exchange revealed that his day-to-day experience wouldn’t be all that different.  While he might travel a bit more, or upgrade for more legroom when he flies, he was going to keep the same apartment, the same job, and the same basically everything else.  The money will just provide some extra optionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing I learned from thinking about all of this is that it takes a giant step in wealth to fundamentally alter how we live our lives.  And the steps only get larger as we go higher up the wealth scale.  So think about whether that step is worth it.  Whether the juice is worth the squeeze.  Until next time, thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Engineer says Google fired her for notifying co-workers of right to organize</title>
<link>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/security-engineer-says-google-fired-her-trying-notify-co-workers-n1103031</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/security-engineer-says-google-fired-her-trying-notify-co-workers-n1103031</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;114.87404994571&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Google has fired a security engineer who updated a company tool to notify co-workers of their right to organize, spurring a labor complaint and adding to recent scrutiny of how the company has handled unionization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Kathryn Spiers, who worked as a security engineer, updated an internal Chrome browser extension so that each time Google employees visited the website of IRI Consultants — the Troy, Michigan, firm that Google hired this year amid a groundswell of labor activism at the company — they would see a pop-up message that read: “Googlers have the right to participate in protected concerted activities.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Spiers was placed on administrative leave the week of Thanksgiving, the same week the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/four-ex-google-engineers-ask-federal-probe-thanksgiving-week-firings-n1094706&quot;&gt;fired four other employees&lt;/a&gt; who claim Google has been engaged in illegal efforts to discourage workers engaged in organizing employees. She was fired Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;“We dismissed an employee who abused privileged access to modify an internal security tool,” a Google spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that it was “a serious violation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Spiers said she was acting in the interest of her co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;“I was doing nothing more than notifying my co-workers about Google's obligations under labor law,” Spiers said in a text message. “Googlers are expected to take initiative and it's really important we hold upper management accountable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;11.375&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I was fired last week by Google for organizing. All I did was make a popup to share the labor notice Google has to share with its workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 hours later mgmt came to my desk, took my phone/laptop, escorted me away. I never got to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My story: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/dV4ExPHbLT&quot;&gt;https://t.co/dV4ExPHbLT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Kathryn Spiers (@eiais) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eiais/status/1206937188409044993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;The firing comes at a time of heightened tensions at Google as the company has been forced to reckon with employees’ discontent. Earlier this month, the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/09/google-under-investigation-from-nlrb.html&quot;&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Google's firing of the four workers last month and whether Google discouraged employees from organizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Google workers have also organized internal petitions criticizing the company’s plans to build a censored search engine in China, as well as its cloud contract with the Department of Defense to build artificial intelligence for drones. Last year, Google employees organized a walkout across more than 40 offices to protest how they say the company has mishandled allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Spiers' pop-up message was inserted into a tool that notifies employees of privacy and security concerns about using non-Google tools and services, like warning employees not to upload proprietary information to Dropbox, Spiers said. The tool is managed by the platform security team, for which Spiers worked for almost two years as a security engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Spiers told NBC News that she was inspired to create a digital notification because “a poster in the cafeteria is not the best way of reaching the majority of Googlers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;The message included a link to a statement that the NLRB required the company to post for employees following the settlement of a complaint that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-176462&quot;&gt;filed against Google in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Spiers, 21, said she went through the standard approval process, which requires two co-workers to greenlight changes, before updating the Chrome browser extension. Another source at Google familiar with the update approval process confirmed to NBC news that those two approvals are standard practice for a browser extension update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Three hours after Spiers made the update, she was approached by members of Google’s internal security team and questioned before being placed on administrative leave, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;On Monday, a representative from the Communications Workers of America filed an NLRB charge against Google for Spiers’ termination, accusing it of interfering with her right to organize her co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;“You’re allowed to put posters up on the wall to help organize your workers, and this can be seen as kind of a digital extension of that,” said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. “Whether or not you’re in a union or there’s a union being formed, the law protects organizing activities by employees in the workplace organizing to improve their working conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An opinionated approach to GNU Make</title>
<link>https://tech.davis-hansson.com/p/make/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tech.davis-hansson.com/p/make/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Your Makefiles are full of tabs and errors. An opinionated approach to writing (GNU) Makefiles that I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benbc&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; may still be able to salvage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-opinionated-approach-to-gnu-make&quot;&gt;An opinionated approach to (GNU) Make&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my second hand account of the approach to Make that I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benbc&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;. If something is wrong, assume it was lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things I hope you take away are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The file system is a fundamental part of Make, don't fight it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use sentinel files for targets that do not yield exactly one file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't use tabs, set -ea -o pipefail, and a few other sensible defaults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the above as guidelines, not dogma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it'll make the examples throughout easier to read, lets start with setting sensible defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sensible-defaults&quot;&gt;Sensible defaults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-use-tabs&quot;&gt;Don't use tabs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make leans heavily on the shell, and in the shell spaces matter. Hence, the default behavior in Make of using tabs forces you to mix tabs and spaces, and that leads to readability issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, ask make to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as the block character, by adding this at the top of your makefile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ifeq ($(origin .RECIPEPREFIX), undefined)
  $(error This Make does not support .RECIPEPREFIX. Please use GNU Make 4.0 or later)
endif
.RECIPEPREFIX = &amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really just need the &lt;code&gt;.RECIPEPREFIX = &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; part, but the version check is good since there are a lot of old make binaries floating around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this change, a makefile that previously looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;hello:
    echo &quot;Hello&quot;
    echo &quot;world&quot;
.PHONY: hello
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;hello:
&amp;gt; echo &quot;Hello&quot;
&amp;gt; echo &quot;world&quot;
.PHONY: hello
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you will never again pull your hair out because some editor swapped a tab for four spaces and made Make do insane things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-use-a-recent-bash&quot;&gt;Always use (a recent) bash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make uses &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; as the default shell. People have &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; set up to point to different shell implementations. “Portable shell scripts” is a pipe dream (see what I did there?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell Make “this Makefile is written with Bash as the shell” by adding this to the top of the Makefile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SHELL := bash
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a well-known shell targeted, you can confidently skip workarounds for cross-shell compatibility, and use modern bash features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key message here, of course, is to choose a specific shell. If you'd rather use ZSH, or Python or Node for that matter, set it to that. Pick a specific language so you can stop targeting a lowest common denominator/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-bash-strict-mode&quot;&gt;Use bash strict mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This holds true any time you use bash, but matters particularly here because without this your build may keep executing even if there was a failure in one of the targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a good writeup of what these flags do &lt;a href=&quot;http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this to your Makefile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.SHELLFLAGS := -eu -o pipefail -c  
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-some-make-defaults&quot;&gt;Change some Make defaults&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.ONESHELL&lt;/code&gt; ensures each Make recipe is ran as one single shell session, rather than one new shell per line. This both - in my opinion - is more intuitive, and it lets you do things like loops, variable assignments and so on in bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.DELETE_ON_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; does what it says on the box - if a Make rule fails, it's target file is deleted. This ensures the next time you run Make, it'll properly re-run the failed rule, and guards against broken files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;MAKEFLAGS += --warn-undefined-variables
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does what it says on the tin - if you are referring to Make variables that don't exist, that's probably wrong and it's good to get a warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;MAKEFLAGS += --no-builtin-rules
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disables the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Catalogue-of-Rules.html&quot;&gt;bewildering array&lt;/a&gt; of built in rules to automatically build Yacc grammars out of your data if you accidentally add the wrong file suffix. Remove magic, don't do things unless I tell you to, Make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this preamble in your Makefiles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SHELL := bash
.ONESHELL:
.SHELLFLAGS := -eu -o pipefail -c
.DELETE_ON_ERROR:
MAKEFLAGS += --warn-undefined-variables
MAKEFLAGS += --no-builtin-rules

ifeq ($(origin .RECIPEPREFIX), undefined)
  $(error This Make does not support .RECIPEPREFIX. Please use GNU Make 4.0 or later)
endif
.RECIPEPREFIX = &amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-file-system&quot;&gt;The file system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trigger for this post was a Makefile that was sent to me as the official “this is how you do it” example from a large software company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all the Makefiles I wrote before Ben showed me better, it used Make without regard for its connection to the file system. In this rendition, Make is a tool for writing tab-indented named shell snippets that depend on each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These uses would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;test:
&amp;gt; npm run test
        
deploy: test
&amp;gt; gsutil .. 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is bad. Make sees each target (“test” and “deploy”) as the output file name of the associated block of code. If the output file exists, Make may decide that it doesn't need to run the code, since the file is already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you stashed some data in a file named &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;. The above Makefile will see that &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; is a file that exists, and that there are no dependencies for the &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; rule. Hence, no need to “rebuild” the test file, and voila you've deployed to prod without running tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you strictly want a target that generates no files, tell Make by saying it is “.PHONY”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;test:
&amp;gt; npm run test
.PHONY: test  # Make will not look for a file named `test` on the file system
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;generating-output-files&quot;&gt;Generating output files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, then, each Make rule follows a convention like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output-file&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;input file1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;input file 2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;input file n&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script to create output-file from input files&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make calls the output the “target”, the inputs the “prerequisites” and the script the “recipe”. The entire thing is called a “rule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you want to build a docker image for your little Node app. The output file might be a small file that records the image id:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;out/image-id: 
&amp;gt; image_id=&quot;example.com/my-app:$$(pwgen -1)&quot;
&amp;gt; docker build --tag=&quot;$${image_id}
&amp;gt; echo &quot;$${image_id}&quot; &amp;gt; out/image-id
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor asides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note the use of $$ instead of $ for bash variables and subshells; Make uses $ for it's own templating variables, $$ escapes it so bash sees a single $.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please ignore the pwgen bit, just need something that generates a random id for the image; much better option here is to hash the image inputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Make rule now will generate an output file that contains our image id. Other rules can depend on it, and it's easy for us to use the image id in deploy scripts and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;there are problems here&lt;/em&gt;. Our rule specifies no prerequisites, so once the file exists, Make will never rebuild it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;specifying-inputs&quot;&gt;Specifying inputs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have make understand when to rebuild our docker image and when not to, we need to tell it what our docker image is built out of. When those prerequisites change, it needs to rebuild the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;out/image-id: src/main.js src/views.js
&amp;gt; image_id=&quot;example.com/my-app:$$(pwgen -1)&quot;
&amp;gt; docker build --tag=&quot;$${image_id}
&amp;gt; echo &quot;$${image_id}&quot; &amp;gt; out/image-id
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you made a change to &lt;code&gt;main.js&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;views.js&lt;/code&gt;, Make will rebuild the image. However, maintaining a list of all the source files is a massive pain - and of course unnecessary, the file system already knows this information, so lets just ask it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like mentioned earlier, Make recognizes $-prefixed variables and commands. One such command is &lt;code&gt;shell&lt;/code&gt;, which lets us run a shell command and have its output substituted into our Makefile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find all the source files, you might do something like: &lt;code&gt;find src/ -type f&lt;/code&gt;. Simply replace the manual listing of prerequisite files with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;out/image-id: $(shell find src -type f)
&amp;gt; image_id=&quot;example.com/my-app:$$(pwgen -1)&quot;
&amp;gt; docker build --tag=&quot;$${image_id}
&amp;gt; echo &quot;$${image_id}&quot; &amp;gt; out/image-id
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sentinel-files&quot;&gt;Sentinel files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to have one rule generate multiple files. For instance, the Webpack webapp bundler might yield lots of output files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;index.html: $(shell find src -type f)
&amp;gt; node run webpack ..
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Make will only rebuild the target if &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; is older than either of the dependencies. What if some other file outputted by webpack is much older? You can write a target with a templated output to have Make handle this. If you hate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes particularly insane once you start running Make in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better option is to have rules that yield lots of files have a “sentinel” output. A single file that you know Make will look at to tell if a rebuild is needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;out/.packed.sentinel: $(shell find src -type f)
&amp;gt; node run webpack ..
&amp;gt; touch out/.packed.sentinel
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-make-magic-variables&quot;&gt;On Make magic variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make has a bunch of cryptic magic variables that refer to things like the targets and prerequisites of rules. I mostly think these should be avoided, because they are hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for the sentinel file pattern, the magic variable &lt;code&gt;$(@D)&lt;/code&gt;, which refers to the directory the target should go in, and &lt;code&gt;$@&lt;/code&gt;, which refers to the target, are common enough that you quickly learn to recognize what they mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;out/.packed.sentinel: $(shell find src -type f)
&amp;gt; mkdir -p $(@D) # expands to `mkdir -p out`
&amp;gt; node run webpack ..
&amp;gt; touch $@  # expands to `touch out/.packed.sentinel`
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, for a Makefile to build a Node app and package it into a docker image, you might do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SHELL := bash
.ONESHELL:
.SHELLFLAGS := -eu -o pipefail -c
.DELETE_ON_ERROR:
MAKEFLAGS += --warn-undefined-variables
MAKEFLAGS += --no-builtin-rules

ifeq ($(origin .RECIPEPREFIX), undefined)
  $(error This Make does not support .RECIPEPREFIX. Please use GNU Make 4.0 or later)
endif
.RECIPEPREFIX = &amp;gt;

# Default - top level rule is what gets ran when you run just `make`
build: out/image-id
.PHONY: build

# Clean up the output directories; since all the sentinel files go under tmp, this will cause everything to get rebuilt
clean:
&amp;gt; rm -rf tmp
&amp;gt; rm -rf out
.PHONY: clean

# Tests - re-ran if any file under src has been changed since tmp/.tests-passed.sentinel was last touched
tmp/.tests-passed.sentinel: $(shell find src -type f)
&amp;gt; mkdir -p $(@D)
&amp;gt; node run test
&amp;gt; touch $@ 

# Webpack - re-built if the tests have been rebuilt (and so, by proxy, whenever the source files have changed)
tmp/.packed.sentinel: tmp/.tests-passed.sentinel
&amp;gt; mkdir -p $(@D)
&amp;gt; webpack ..
&amp;gt; touch $@

# Docker image - re-built if the webpack output has been rebuilt
out/image-id: tmp/.packed.sentinel
&amp;gt; mkdir -p $(@D)
&amp;gt; image_id=&quot;example.com/my-app:$$(pwgen -1)&quot;
&amp;gt; docker build --tag=&quot;$${image_id}
&amp;gt; echo &quot;$${image_id}&quot; &amp;gt; out/image-id
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-is-not-dogma&quot;&gt;This is not dogma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the virtues of Make, to me, is that it is pragmatic. Counterintuitively, I think part of the reason Make has managed to maintain simplicity is precisely because it has allowed some hacks to accumulate in the tool itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to expand the model to be more generic, to incorporate new concepts, making the core model more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the hacks have allowed the exceptional beauty of the core model - a way to describe file construction pipelines tightly connected with the file system tree - to remain simple.&lt;/p&gt;
