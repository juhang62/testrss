<title>Maine passes bill to prevent ISPs from selling browsing data without consent</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/maine-internet-history-data/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/maine-internet-history-data/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Good news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maine lawmakers have &lt;a href=&quot;http://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280072014&quot;&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; that will prevent internet providers from selling consumers’ private internet data to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s senate unanimously passed the bill 35-0 on Thursday following an earlier vote by state representatives 96-45 in favor of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, if signed into law by state governor Janet Mills, will force the national and smaller regional internet providers operating in the state to first obtain permission from residents before their data can be sold or passed on to advertisers or other third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maine has about 1.3 million residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission voted in 2017 to allow internet providers to sell customers’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/everything-you-need-to-know-about-congress-decision-to-expose-your-data-to-internet-providers/&quot;&gt;private and personal internet data and browsing histories&lt;/a&gt; — including which websites a user visits and for how long — to advertisers for the biggest buck. Congress later &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/&quot;&gt;passed the measure into law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclumaine.org/en/news/dont-believe-corporate-interests-maine-really-does-need-isp-privacy-bill&quot;&gt;the ACLU explained&lt;/a&gt; how this rule change affected ordinary Americans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your internet provider sees everything you do online. Even if the website you’re visiting is encrypted, your ISP can still see the website name, how frequently you visit the website, and how long you’re there for. And, because you are a paying customer, your ISP knows your social security number, full legal name, address, and bank account information. Linking all that information can reveal a lot about you – for example, if you are visiting a religious website or a support site for people with a particular illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its latest remarks, the ACLU — which along with the Open Technology Institute and New America helped to draft the legislation — praised lawmakers for passing the bill, calling it the “strongest” internet privacy bill of any state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, the Maine legislature did what the U.S. Congress has thus far failed to do and voted to put consumer privacy before corporate profits,” said Oamshri Amarasingham, advocacy director at the ACLU of Maine, in  a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody should have to choose between using the internet and protecting their own data,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Undervalued Engineering Skills: Writing Well</title>
<link>https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been coaching several experienced software engineers to further grow professionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/things-ive-learned-transitioning-from-engineer-to-engineering-manager/&quot;&gt;since transitioning&lt;/a&gt; to being an engineering manager. I have noticed a few skills that people often underestimate the importance of developing. Skills that add a significant boost to the impact of any developer. One of these ones is writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most software engineers primarily focus on becoming great at writing code. And this makes perfect sense. This is an essential step to become a great engineer within a reasonably sized team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful companies, however, grow continuously. Sooner or later, the software engineering team will be beyond a few dozen people, where everyone can easily talk with everyone else. People will be split across different floors. New offices in different locations will be opened. Face-to-face communication starts to be insufficient. Channels like email, chat or video calls become more important. The pace of which this growth happens varies by company: for some, it takes years. For some of the really successful companies, it happens much more rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is with a larger organisation that writing becomes important&lt;/strong&gt; for messages to reach a wider group of people. For software engineers, writing becomes the tool to reach, converse with and influence engineers and teams outside their immediate peers. Writing becomes essential to make thoughts, tradeoffs and decisions durable. Writing things down makes these thoughts available for a wide range of people to read. Things that should be made durable can include proposals and decisions, coding guidelines, best practices, learnings, runbooks, debugging guides, postmortems. Even code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For people to read what you write, it needs to be written well&lt;/strong&gt;. If you grab people's attention early on, they will keep reading and they will receive the message you intended to get across. More of them will respond to it and do it without few misunderstandings on what you meant. By writing well, you can scale your ability to communicate efficiently to multiple teams, to an organisation or across the company. And the ability to communicate and influence beyond your immediate team is the essential skill for engineers growing in seniority - from senior engineer to what organizations might call lead, principle, staff or distinguished engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how can you work on becoming better at writing?&lt;/strong&gt; Writing clearly, concisely and in a way that is easy to read? As with every skill, it's a matter of being aware of the fundamentals, practicing, getting feedback and repeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the learning the fundamentals, books are a good place to start. Ones I frequently recommend engineers to start with are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548&quot;&gt;On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799&quot;&gt;The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being aware of the fundamentals, re-reading your own writing and ruthlessly re-editing is the next step in becoming a better writer. Putting yourself in the shoes of who you write for and asking yourself if you are grabbing their attention early is key. Challenging yourself to deliver the same message in a shorter form and re-writing your content is another. Immediate feedback from services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grammarly.com/?q=brand&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand_f1&amp;amp;utm_content=329885936576&amp;amp;utm_term=grammarly&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;placement=&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8LTmBRBCEiwAbhh-6KorySxdXM-Qxp-y_iZmnE7SIMm79iuhZ0a9lrSrKv86VD3VrsLecxoCMh8QAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://readable.com/&quot;&gt;Readable&lt;/a&gt; are helpful. Asking for feedback on your emails and documents from people who you have seen write well is another way to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't take this advice just from me&lt;/strong&gt;. Take it from others, like employee #8 and now SVP of engineering at Google, Urs Hölzle who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6530173230102122496&quot;&gt;also says&lt;/a&gt; that writing clearly is an important superpower for engineers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers often underestimate the importance of writing well. Invest in this skill to scale your ability to get your message to others, becoming a more influential engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Abuses show Assange case was never about law</title>
<link>https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2019-05-27/abuses-show-assange-case-was-never-about-law/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2019-05-27/abuses-show-assange-case-was-never-about-law/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It is astonishing how often one still hears well-informed, otherwise reasonable people say about Julian Assange: “But he ran away from Swedish rape charges by hiding in Ecuador’s embassy in London.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That short sentence includes at least three factual errors. In fact, to repeat it, as so many people do, you would need to have been hiding under a rock for the past decade – or, amounting to much the same thing, been relying on the corporate media for your information about Assange, including from supposedly liberal outlets such as the Guardian and the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the weekend, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dumptheguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-julian-assange-send-him-to-sweden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Guardian editorial&lt;/a&gt; – the paper’s official voice and probably the segment most scrutinised by senior staff – made just such a false claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the rape charge that Mr Assange faced in Sweden and which led him to seek refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Guardian, supposedly the British media’s chief defender of liberal values, can make this error-strewn statement after nearly a decade of Assange-related coverage is simply astounding. And that it can make such a statement days after the US finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dumptheguardian.com/media/2019/may/23/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-with-violating-the-espionage-act-in-18-count-indictment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; that it wants to lock up Assange for 175 years on bogus “espionage” charges – a hand anyone who wasn’t being wilfully blind always knew the US was preparing to play – is still more shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange faces no charges in Sweden yet, let alone “rape charges”. As former UK ambassador Craig Murray recently explained, the Guardian has been misleading readers by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2019/05/the-missing-step/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;falsely claiming&lt;/a&gt; that an attempt by a Swedish prosecutor to extradite Assange – even though the move has not received the Swedish judiciary’s approval – is the same as his arrest on rape charges. It isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Assange did not seek sanctuary in the embassay to evade the Swedish investigation. No state in the world gives a non-citizen &lt;em&gt;political asylum&lt;/em&gt; to avoid a rape trial. The asylum was granted on &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; grounds. Ecuador rightly accepted Assange’s concerns that the US would seek his extradition and lock him out of sight for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange, of course, has been proven – yet again – decisively right by recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trapped in herd-think&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that so many ordinary people keep making these basic errors has a very obvious explanation. It is because the corporate media keep making these errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are is not the kind of mistakes that can be explained away as an example of what one journalist has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dumptheguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/04/comment.pressandpublishing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;termed&lt;/a&gt; the problem of “churnalism”: the fact that journalists, chasing breaking news in offices depleted of staff by budget cuts, are too overworked to cover stories properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British journalists have had many years to get the facts straight. In an era of social media, journalists at the Guardian and the BBC have been bombarded by readers and activists with messages telling them how they are getting basic facts wrong in the Assange case. But the journalists keep doing it anyway. They are trapped in a herd-think entirely divorced from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than listen to experts, or common sense, these “journalists” keep regurgitating the talking points of the British security state, which are as good as identical to the talking points of the US security state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is so striking in the Assange coverage is the sheer number of legal anomalies in his case – and these have been accumulating relentlessly &lt;em&gt;from the very start&lt;/em&gt;. Almost nothing in his case has gone according to the normal rules of legal procedure. And yet that very revealing fact is never noticed or commented on by the corporate media. You need to have a blind spot the size of Langley, Virginia, not to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Assange wasn’t the head of Wikileaks, if he hadn’t embarrassed the most important western states and their leaders by divulging their secrets and crimes, if he hadn’t created a platform that allows whistleblowers to reveal the outrages committed by the western power establishment, if he hadn’t undermined that establishment’s control over information dissemination, none of the last 10 years would have followed the course it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5rXPrfnU3G0&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=&quot;bookmark&quot; class=&quot;mce_SELRES_start&quot;&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Assange had not provided us with an information revolution that undermines the narrative matrix created to serve the US security state, two Swedish women – unhappy with Assange’s sexual etiquette – would have gotten exactly what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; said in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/assange-smear-2-hes-a-rapist-df9effd8b49d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;witness statements&lt;/a&gt; they wanted: pressure from the Swedish authorites to make him take an HIV test to give them peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would have been allowed back to the UK (as he in fact was allowed to do by the Swedish prosecutor) and would have gotten on with developing and refining the Wikileaks project. That would have helped all of us to become more critically aware of how we are being manipulated – not only by our security services but also by the corporate media that so often act as their mouthpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is precisely why that did not happen and why Assange has been under some form of detention since 2010. Since then, his ability to perform his role as exposer of serial high-level state crimes has been ever more impeded – to the point now that he may never be able to oversee and direct Wikileaks ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His current situation – locked up in Belmarsh high-security prison, in solitary confinement and deprived of access to a computer and all meaningful contact with the outside world – is so far based solely on the fact that he committed a minor infraction, breaching his police bail. Such a violation, committed by anyone else, &lt;a href=&quot;https://greenandblackcross.org/guides/should-i-ignore-police-bail/2-breaching-bail-conditions-is-not-a-crime/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;almost never incurs&lt;/a&gt; prosecution, let alone a lengthy jail sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is a far from complete list – aided by the research of John Pilger, Craig Murray and Caitlin Johnstone, and the original investigative work of Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi – of some of the most glaring anomalies in Assange’s legal troubles. There are 17 of them below. Each might conceivably have been possible in isolation. But taken together they are overwhelming evidence that this was never about enforcing the law. From the start, Assange faced political persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No judicial authority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* In late summer 2010, neither of the two Swedish women alleged Assange had raped them when they made police &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnpilger.com/articles/getting-julian-assange-the-untold-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;statements&lt;/a&gt;. They went together to the police station after finding out that Assange had slept with them both only a matter of days apart and wanted him to be forced to take an HIV test. One of the women, SW, refused to sign the police statement when she understood the police were seeking an indictment for rape. The investigation relating to the second woman, AA, was for a sexual assault specific to Sweden. A condom produced by AA that she says Assange tore during sex was found to have neither her nor Assange’s DNA on it, undermining her credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Sweden’s strict laws protecting suspects during preliminary investigations were violated by the Swedish media to smear Assange as a rapist. In response, the Stockholm chief prosecutor, Eva Finne, took charge and quickly &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnpilger.com/articles/getting-julian-assange-the-untold-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;cancelled the investigation&lt;/a&gt;: “I don’t believe there is any reason to suspect that he has committed rape.” She later concluded: “There is no suspicion of any crime whatsoever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The case was revived by another prosecutor, Marianne Ny, although she never questioned Assange. He spent more than a month in Sweden waiting for developments in the case, but was then told by prosecutors he was free to leave for the UK, suggesting that suspicions against him were not considered serious enough to detain him in Sweden. Nonetheless, shortly afterwards, Interpol &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wikileaks-assange-interpol-idUSTRE6B00BQ20101201&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a Red Notice for Assange, usually reserved for terrorists and dangerous criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The UK supreme court approved an extradition to Sweden based on a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) in 2010, despite the fact that it was not signed by a “judicial authority”, only by the Swedish prosecutor. The terms of the EAW agreement were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2019/05/the-missing-step/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;amended&lt;/a&gt; by the UK government shortly after the Assange ruling to make sure such an abuse of legal procedure never occurred again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The UK supreme court also approved Assange’s extradition even though Swedish authorities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/09/sweden-should-issue-assurance-it-won-t-extradite-assange-usa/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to offer an assurance that he would not be extradited onwards to the US, where a grand jury was already formulating draconian charges in secret against him under the Espionage Act. The US similarly refused to give an assurance they would not seek his extradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* In these circumstances, Assange fled to Ecuador’s embassy in London in summer 2012, seeking political asylum. That was after the Swedish prosecutor, Marianne Ny, blocked Assange’s chance to &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/R7oFP#selection-361.0-389.467&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt; to the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Australia not only refused Assange, a citizen, any help during his long ordeal, but prime minister Julia Gillard even &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnpilger.com/articles/getting-julian-assange-the-untold-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to strip Assange of his citizenship, until it was pointed out that it would be illegal for Australia to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Britain, meanwhile, not only surrounded the embassy with a large police force at great public expense, but William Hague, the foreign secretary, threatened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnpilger.com/articles/getting-julian-assange-the-untold-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;tear up&lt;/a&gt; the Vienna Convention, violating Ecuador’s diplomatic territory by sending UK police into the embassy to arrest Assange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Six years of heel-dragging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Although Assange was still formally under investigation, Ny refused to come to London to interview him, despite similar interviews having been conducted by Swedish prosecutors &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnpilger.com/articles/getting-julian-assange-the-untold-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;44 times&lt;/a&gt; in the UK in the period Assange was denied that right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* In 2016, international legal experts in the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which adjudicates on whether governments have complied with human rights obligations, ruled that Assange was being detained unlawfully by Britain and Sweden. Although both countries participated in the UN investigation, and had given the tribunal vocal support when other countries were found guilty of human rights violations, they steadfastly ignored its ruling in favour of Assange. UK Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond flat-out lied in claiming the UN panel was “made up of lay people and not lawyers”. The tribunal comprises leading experts in international law, as is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/02/philip-hammonds-astonishing-lie/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;clear&lt;/a&gt; from their CVs. Nonetheless, the lie became Britain’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/02/kafka-2016/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;official response&lt;/a&gt; to the UN ruling. The British media performed no better. A Guardian editorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dumptheguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-julian-assange-no-victim-of-arbitrary-detention&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; the verdict as nothing more than a “publicity stunt”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Ny finally relented on Assange being interviewed in November 2016, with a Swedish prosecutor sent to London after six years of heel-dragging. However, Assange’s Swedish lawyer was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dumptheguardian.com/media/2016/nov/14/julian-assange-to-face-swedish-prosecutors-over-accusation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;barred&lt;/a&gt; from being present. Ny was due to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/DTL6P#selection-1100.1-1121.233&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt; about the interview by a Stockholm judge in May 2017 but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dumptheguardian.com/media/2017/may/19/swedish-prosecutors-drop-julian-assange-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;closed the investigation&lt;/a&gt; against Assange the very same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* In fact, correspondence that was later revealed under a Freedom of Information request – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2018/02/13/news/few_documents_many_mysteries_how_our_foia_case_is_unveiling_the_questionable_handling_of_the_julian_assange_case-188758273/?refresh_ce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;pursued&lt;/a&gt; by Italian investigative journalist Stefania Maurizi – shows that the British prosecution service, the CPS, pressured the Swedish prosecutor not to come to the London to interview Assange through 2010 and 2011, thereby creating the embassy standoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Also, the CPS destroyed most of the incriminating correspondence to circumvent the FoI requests. The emails that surfaced did so only because some copies were accidentally overlooked in the destruction spree. Those emails were bad enough. They show that in 2013 Sweden had wanted to drop the case against Assange but had come under strong British pressure to continue the pretence of seeking his extradition. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2018-02-12/the-uks-hidden-role-in-assanges-detention/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; from the CPS stating, “Don’t you dare” drop the case, and most revealing of all: “Please do not think this case is being dealt with as just another extradition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* It also emerged that Marianne Ny had &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/assange-smear-2-hes-a-rapist-df9effd8b49d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;deleted&lt;/a&gt; an email she received from the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Despite his interview with a Swedish prosecutor taking place in late 2016, Assange was not subseqently charged in absentia – an &lt;a href=&quot;https://sputniknews.com/europe/201603061035874931-sweden-russian-national-crime/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;option&lt;/a&gt; Sweden could have pursued if it had thought the evidence was strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* After Sweden dropped the investigation against Assange, his lawyers sought last year to get the British arrest warrant for his bail breach dropped. They had good grounds, both because the allegations over which he’d been bailed had been dropped by Sweden and because he had justifiable cause to seek asylum given the apparent US interest in extraditing him and locking him up for life for political crimes. His lawyers could also argue convincingly that the time he had spent in confinement, first under house arrest and then in the embassy, was more than equivalent to time, if any, that needed to be served for the bail infringement. However, the judge, Emma Arbuthnot, rejected the Assange team’s strong legal arguments. She was hardly a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/02/pretence-persecution-assange/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;dispassionate observer&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, in a properly ordered world she should have recused herself, given that she is the wife of a government whip, who was also a business partner of a former head of MI6, Britain’s version of the CIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Assange’s legal rights were again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dumptheguardian.com/media/2019/may/19/us-prosecutors-julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuadorian-embassy&quot;&gt;flagrantly violated&lt;/a&gt; last week, with the collusion of Ecuador and the UK, when US prosecutors were allowed to seize Assange’s personal items from the embassy while his lawyers and UN officials were denied the right to be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Information dark ages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, as the US prepares its case to lock Assange away for the rest of his life, most are still refusing to join the dots. Chelsea Manning has been repeatedly jailed, and is now facing ruinous fines for every day she refuses to testify against Assange as the US desperately seeks to prop up its bogus espionage claims. In Medieval times, the authorities were more honest: they simply put people on the rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2017, when the rest of the media were still pretending this was all about Assange fleeing Swedish “justice”, John Pilger noted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, a secret Pentagon document prepared by the “Cyber Counterintelligence Assessments Branch” foretold a detailed plan to discredit WikiLeaks and smear Assange personally. The “mission” was to destroy the “trust” that was WikiLeaks’ “centre of gravity”. This would be achieved with threats of “exposure [and] criminal prosecution”. Silencing and criminalising such an unpredictable source of truth-telling was the aim.” …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Australian diplomatic cables, Washington’s bid to get Assange is “unprecedented in scale and nature”. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Justice Department has contrived charges of “espionage”, “conspiracy to commit espionage”, “conversion” (theft of government property), “computer fraud and abuse” (computer hacking) and general “conspiracy”. The favoured Espionage Act, which was meant to deter pacifists and conscientious objectors during World War One, has provisions for life imprisonment and the death penalty. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, a federal court in Washington blocked the release of all information about the “national security” investigation against WikiLeaks, because it was “active and ongoing” and would harm the “pending prosecution” of Assange. The judge, Barbara J. Rothstein, said it was necessary to show “appropriate deference to the executive in matters of national security”. This is a kangaroo court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this information was available to any journalist or newspaper  that cared to search it out and wished to publicise it. And yet not one corporate media outlet – apart from Stefania Maurizi – has done so over the past nine years. Instead they have shored up a series of preposterous US and UK state narratives designed to keep Assange behind bars and propel the rest of us back into the information dark ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully cleared another critical testing milestone, taking this ambitious observatory one step closer to its 2021 launch. The spacecraft has gone through its final thermal vacuum test meant to ensure that its hardware will function electronically in the vacuum of space, and withstand the extreme temperature variations it will encounter on its mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;article-banner first-banner&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;One half of the Webb observatory, known as the &quot;spacecraft element,&quot; completed this testing at the facilities of Northrop Grumman, the mission's lead industrial partner, in Los Angeles. The other half of Webb, which consists of the telescope and science instruments, has already successfully completed its &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/thermal+vacuum+testing/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;thermal vacuum testing&lt;/a&gt; at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston prior to delivery at Northrop Grumman last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent major environmental &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/test/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;, technicians and engineers locked the Webb spacecraft element inside a special thermal &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/vacuum/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;vacuum&lt;/a&gt; chamber. The testing team drained the atmosphere from the room to replicate the vacuum of space, and exposed the Webb spacecraft element to a wide range of hot and cold temperatures, spanning from minus 235 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 148 degrees Celsius) to a sweltering 215 degrees Fahrenheit (102 degrees Celsius). This variation of temperatures ensures the spacecraft will survive the extreme conditions it will actually experience in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft element consists of the &quot;bus,&quot; which is the equipment that actually flies the observatory in space, plus the revolutionary five-layer tennis-court-size sunshield that will keep Webb's sensitive optics and instruments in the shade, and at their required super-cold operating temperatures. The spacecraft element is imperative to the success of Webb's scientific goals, and must be thoroughly tested and validated for flight.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Northrop Grumman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the completion of this latest thermal vacuum test, all of Webb's components have been exposed to the varied conditions that they will encounter during launch, and while in orbit a million miles away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The teams from Northrop Grumman and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center are to be commended for a successful spacecraft thermal vacuum test, dedicating long hours to get where we are now,&quot; said Jeanne Davis, program manager for the James Webb Space Telescope Program. &quot;This incredible accomplishment paves the way for the next major milestone, which is to integrate the telescope and the spacecraft elements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps will be to join both halves of Webb to form the fully assembled observatory and complete a final round of deployments, testing and evaluation prior to launch. A full deployment of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/spacecraft/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; element will verify that Webb is ready to proceed to the launch site.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Grew Up Gifted, but My Life Didn’t Turn Out the Way I Expected</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/i-grew-up-gifted-but-my-life-didnt-turn-out-the-way-i-expected</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/i-grew-up-gifted-but-my-life-didnt-turn-out-the-way-i-expected</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;“It’s a shame Heather never did anything with her life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casual comment from a family member to my dad stings to this day. I was about 30 at the time, and my husband, young son and I were living in my parents’ house. We had moved in while I was enduring a difficult pregnancy and had decided to stay for a few years after. I was working as a daycare teacher. The comment wasn’t meant to imply that I was a degenerate. This family member was voicing the feelings that have so often haunted me in my adult life – I wasn’t living up to my potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential. It’s a word I started hearing in toddlerhood. My parents noticed there was something different about me early on, and those observations were validated when I received a gifted designation at age five. The school suggested I skip grade one, which my parents declined. I started a part-time gifted program instead, and then transitioned into a full-time gifted class in Grade 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You'll Also Love:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/why-im-sending-my-child-to-forest-school-and-not-kindergarten&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why I'm Sending My Child To Forest School And Not Kindergarten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought being gifted was setting me up for success in life. Everything, at least academically, came very easily to me. I was bombarded with comments about how smart I was and how I would certainly be going places and achieving great success in life. I believed it. After all, everything I touched turned to gold. As fellow former gifted child Adam Smith (name changed), 42, put it, “I certainly remember feeling that school was easy, and that concept of ease affected my world view. Since school was preparation for life, [then] life must be easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the protection of academia, I became intensely aware that I had never learned how to work for things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first hint that this was a skewed view came in university. I very quickly learned that, while I may have been the “best” in all of my high school classes, I was now in a place where my peers had been the “best” in theirs as well — and in most cases, their best was better than mine. This realization automatically dulled some of my drive to succeed. I would never gain the admiration and accolades I had received my whole life up until this point, so where was the desire to try? Still, I managed to get by receiving relatively good grades without an extreme amount of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real life hit me like a tidal wave. Outside the protection of academia, I became intensely aware that I had never learned how to work for things. Enough things came easily to me that if I wasn’t good at it, I simply didn’t do it. I’ve learned in speaking with other people who were deemed gifted as children that this is a common occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terri Moore, 36, said, “I think the fact that academically things came easily to me, and the praise I got for my academics, made me resistant to anything that needed practice. I never got ‘really good’ at anything as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Recommended Reading:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/my-kid-thinks-she-doesnt-need-a-job-because-shes-going-to-be-a-youtube-star&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;My Kid Thinks She Doesn't Need A Job Because She's Going To Be A YouTube Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christina Kimont, 38, speaks of a similar experience. “The fact that I can be immediately good at something has left me as a jack-of-all-trades and master of none, so to speak, and left me rather adrift when it came to finding my life’s purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That so many gifted children begin to view anything that requires work as not worth the effort takes its toll on us as adults. What was an asset in my school years became a hindrance to me in the real world. I watched the peers who I used to view, often smugly, as “average,” achieve far greater personal and professional success than I after graduation. They had learned the value of working towards a goal, and the skills to succeed at it. I had not. They weren’t afraid to try new things, whereas my fear of failure – something I didn’t have a lot of experience with as a child – held me back from making the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fear prompted me to stay in what had been my summer job for over a decade past university graduation. I had the education to land a higher-paying, high-prestige job, but I didn’t have the drive or the courage that benefitted my former peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feelings of personal failure were compounded by the disappointments of people who genuinely expected me to, in their words, “do better” in life. This, too, is common among former gifted children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For so long, being gifted was viewed simply as an asset  — something that made life easier, ignoring the ways in which it can hinder a child’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Bragg-Larocque, 38, describes her experience with this phenomenon. “I feel like when people knew I was identified as being gifted they seemed to expect me to be more successful, or choose a more challenging career. I have been made to feel like a failure or like I wasted my potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimont empathizes. “Living up to my ‘potential’ has been a lifelong struggle. It is the absolute worst thing about being labeled gifted. It instilled pathological perfectionism and crippling anxiety, which both contributed to my concurrent lifelong struggle with depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While plenty of gifted children go on to thrive as adults, the fact that so many of us struggle is enough to reconsider how we handle giftedness. For so long, being gifted was viewed simply as an asset  — something that made life easier, ignoring the ways in which it can hinder a child’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And A Little More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/its-not-just-adults-kids-struggle-impostor-syndrome-low-self-esteem-too&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It's Not Just Adults — Kids Struggle With Imposter Syndrome And Low Self-Esteem Too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now my son is the one being labelled &quot;gifted,&quot; I’m often met with confusion when I express concern over that fact. It’s frequently viewed as a humblebrag. How could anyone not be happy that their child is gifted? But I know the challenges he is going to face. I know how there will come a day when he trades in easy grades for hard life lessons. I know that his brilliant brain will try to confuse and confound him. I worry about him the same way I worry about my other neuro-atypical child with ADHD. It’s hard not being “normal,” even if that difference includes being intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pledge to my gifted son is that I will never allow him to settle for easy, just because he can. I will make sure he experiences trials and failures and ensure that he practices getting back up. I will watch for those “extras” that can come with giftedness, and I won’t allow his intelligence to mask them. And I will never, ever shame him for not reaching a potential I pre-determined for him.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Billions wasted on Hadoop startups, the same will eventually be true of Docker</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2019/05/30/mapr-may-shut-investor-pulls-following-extremely-poor-results/&quot;&gt;The hype over Hadoop has died away and many of the investments now seem to have been terrible investments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MapR Technologies Inc., one of the troika of unicorn startups that emerged from the early days of the big-data movement, may cut up to 122 jobs and shut down its Santa Clara, California headquarters if it can’t secure additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which raised a total of $280 million in financing since it was founded in 2009 and whose market capitalization once topped $1 billion, said it is seeking a “strategic transaction” that would enable it to avoid closing its headquarters. The company said it has “more than one letter of intent from interested parties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…The MapR news didn’t surprise David Vellante, chief analyst at Wikibon, a sister company of SiliconANGLE. “I’ve always said about markets in general – and Hadoop in particular – that the leader can make money, number two is lucky to break even and number three – well it’s not even worth staying in business because there’s no money to be made,” he said. “Think MapR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudera and MapR have both attempted to distance themselves from the Hadoop market in recent years as the once-expected riches failed to materialize. MapR has most recently positioned itself as a universal platform for consolidating and harmonizing multiple data sources, while Cloudera has emphasized product scope and machine learning applications. Competition from cloud computing providers and the difficulty of monetizing a business based upon open-source software have been significant challenges for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money was wasted on hype. The same will eventually be said of Docker. I’ve yet to hear a single benefit attributed to Docker that isn’t also true of other VMs, but standard VMs allow the use of standard operating systems that solved all the hard problems decades ago, whereas Docker is struggling to solve those problems today.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unity Editor for Linux</title>
<link>https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/30/announcing-the-unity-editor-for-linux/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/30/announcing-the-unity-editor-for-linux/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Our new editor for Linux (in preview for Ubuntu and CentOS) brings the benefits of real-time to a whole new platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, we’ve offered an unofficial, experimental Unity Editor for Linux. A growing number of developers using the experimental version, combined with the increasing demand of Unity users in the Film and Automotive, Transportation, and Manufacturing (ATM) industries means that we now plan to officially support the Unity Editor for Linux. Currently, it’s available in preview, and we’re interested in gathering your feedback on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.unity.com/forums/linux-editor.93/&quot; target=&quot;“_blank”&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Unity Editor for Linux forum&lt;/a&gt;. We expect it to be fully supported by Unity 2019.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is accessible by all Personal (free), Plus, and Pro licenses users, starting with Unity 2019.1. We want to focus on making our Editor for Linux as robust and stable as possible, so we’re prioritizing our official support on the following configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CentOS 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;x86-64 architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gnome desktop environment running on top of X11 windowing system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nvidia official proprietary graphics driver and AMD Mesa graphics driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desktop form factors, running on device/hardware without emulation or compatibility layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend you use one of the supported configurations above for the best development experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About 3rd-party tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing to remember: Before you open your projects via the Linux Editor, make sure that any 3rd-party tools you use also support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to get it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the latest builds from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-hub-v-1-6-0-is-now-available.640792/&quot; target=&quot;“_blank”&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Unity Hub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t wait to hear what you think on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.unity.com/forums/linux-editor.93/&quot; target=&quot;“_blank”&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Unity Editor for Linux forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; Real-time data analysis and management are increasingly critical for today`s businesses. SQL is the de facto lingua franca for these endeavors, yet support for robust streaming analysis and management with SQL remains limited. Many approaches restrict semantics to a reduced subset of features and/or require a suite of non-standard constructs. Additionally, use of event timestamps to provide native support for analyzing events according to when they actually occurred is not pervasive, and often comes with important limitations. We present a three-part proposal for integrating robust streaming into the SQL standard, namely: (1) time-varying relations as a foundation for classical tables as well as streaming data, (2) event time semantics, (3) a limited set of optional keyword extensions to control the materialization of time-varying query results. Motivated and illustrated using examples and lessons learned from implementations in Apache Calcite, Apache Flink, and Apache Beam, we show how with these minimal additions it is possible to utilize the complete suite of standard SQL semantics to perform robust stream processing.&lt;/p&gt;
