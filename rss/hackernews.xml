<title>How I Run a Company with ADHD</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;For the first 19 years of my life &lt;strong&gt;I knew I was lazy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was smart, but I constantly slacked off. I found the smallest amount of work I could get away with doing and did no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was often reminded that I wasn't living up to my potential. &quot;If B's were all you were capable of that would be fine, but you're so smart. You could easily get an A,&quot; was a regular refrain in my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone around me seemed to find it easy to get work done. Why wasn't I that way? What the fuck was wrong with me? Why was I so weak that I couldn't stand to do anything remotely hard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It filled me with shame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a nerd, always have been. I wasn't fast or strong, my face was covered in zits and I got super nervous around girls. I was happiest with my nose in the book or hanging out with my Boy Scout troop. School was the only thing I was good at. And I kept fucking up at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It got worse in college.&lt;/strong&gt; First, smart phones became a part of the classroom. Then I discovered I could get away with skipping most of my classes all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grades started slipping, and I went from skating by, to struggling to keep up. The B's turned into C's and D's. Now piled on top of the shame, I started doubting my abilities for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year I turned 20 &lt;strong&gt;there were two big changes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-i-got-diagnosed-with-adhd&quot;&gt;1) I got diagnosed with ADHD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my grades started slipping the shame piled up. I had to admit something wasn't working. I was beating myself up, and my grades weren't getting better. I take pride in being self-reliant, asking for help made me feel weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this was a dumb way of looking at life. It's never bad to ask for help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the direction I was heading scared me. So I went to see a psychologist. Within 4 sessions I got a diagnosis. &lt;strong&gt;I had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puzzle pieces started to fall into place. When you have ADHD it feels like your head is constantly buzzing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.andrewaskins.com/content/images/2019/05/adhd-storytelling.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasks as innocuous as putting away clothes can be a trap. The extra time it takes to do something as simple as open the drawer is time for your brain to get distracted. And then it could be an hour before you remember what you were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you're struggling with ADHD, check out the book&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;OneJS=1&amp;amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;source=ac&amp;amp;ref=tf_til&amp;amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;amp;tracking_id=andrewaskins-20&amp;amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;amp;region=US&amp;amp;placement=1592335128&amp;amp;asins=1592335128&amp;amp;linkId=ef5420c0727f83d70758a9101a625f83&amp;amp;show_border=false&amp;amp;link_opens_in_new_window=false&amp;amp;price_color=333333&amp;amp;title_color=0066C0&amp;amp;bg_color=FFFFFF&quot;&gt;Organizing Solutions for People With ADHD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It gave me useful tips, but more importantly taught me about how ADHD works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-i-started-a-company&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) I started a company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spring of 2014 I started my company, Krit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blurt.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/images/5c317886e7e201010a7e2295/image_HG0Y6_a7B&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the date of our first launch approached I barely slept. Around 4 am I would call an Uber, then my dad would drop me off on his way to work at 8. Some nights I didn't even leave the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blurt.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/images/5c317886e7e201010a7e2295/image__GKMdQ-Ji&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy? No. But I was working harder than I ever had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one of the greatest gifts I've ever received. Because one day it hit me. &lt;strong&gt;I was working harder than I ever had before.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wasn't lazy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually got immense pride from working. It just took the right combination of motivation and constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That spring was almost 5 years ago.&lt;/strong&gt; Krit should make over $600,000 in revenue this year, and is now a team of 8. We've helped clients launch 8 new startups and 2 non-profit initiatives. We've built a small audience and products of our own. Our clients have sold their software to names like Facebook, Red Bull and Yale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting diagnosed and starting the company showed me that I wasn't lazy. &lt;strong&gt;Now I had hope.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-pressure-of-adhd-as-a-founder&quot;&gt;The pressure of ADHD as a founder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, hope is only the first ingredient. Learning I'm not lazy was powerful, but 5 years later I'm still fighting to make myself believe it. &lt;strong&gt;Those feelings didn't magically go away forever.&lt;/strong&gt; They still come back in waves until I fight them back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when they come back, the pressure is even higher. If I have a bad day I worry I'm setting a bad example for my employees or letting down a client. Getting behind can have major consequences. I often work extra hours to make up for the time I spent distracted and then feel myself burning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD seems like an innocuous disorder. Everyone procrastinates right? So what, you can't stop bouncing your leg at the restaurant? So what you get distracted every time you see something shiny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes ADHD dangerous is the stress and shame that come with it.&lt;/strong&gt; The shame of feeling lazy, or dumb or socially awkward. The stress of not doing enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.andrewaskins.com/content/images/2019/05/simple-tasks.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be halfway through a team meeting and realize I haven't heard anything that was said. That's ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take a break to read an article and hours will go by before I realize what's happened. Not minutes, hours. That's ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADHD can feel almost like time-traveling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be something unproductive like Twitter that initiates it either. I'll be working on a task, when I'll remember something else that needs to get done. I'll start working on that, and hours later realize the first task is still half-completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.andrewaskins.com/content/images/2019/05/hyperfocus.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I'm writing this I've stopped half a dozen times to wipe dog hair from my computer. Pulling my mind back to the article feels like reigning in an unruly horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-deal-with-adhd-as-a-founder&quot;&gt;How I deal with ADHD as a founder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time though, I am getting better at managing myself. Here are ways I've found of coping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;prioritize-obsessively&quot;&gt;Prioritize obsessively&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start every day/week with a task list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you're fighting ADHD, external stimuli are your enemies&lt;/strong&gt;. Unstructured time (when your mind is wandering) is exactly when those stimuli attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Todoist these days to keep my list up to date. In the past I've used a straight up note or even a Slack message to myself. The key for me is for it to be super fast to add and reorganize tasks. The structure also has to be super simple. Too much organization is bad for someone with ADHD, because it's a chance to get distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todoist has a great mobile app, and makes it super easy to prioritize tasks and move them between days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blurt.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/images/5c317886e7e201010a7e2295/image_xdT5zg9Qt&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to keep your daily list small (I try to cap it at 5-6 tasks) and don't beat yourself up for moving things around. That unstructured time where you get distracted can also generate creative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-with-a-small-win&quot;&gt;Start with a small win&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often start with a lower priority task that I can get knocked out quickly. I've heard lots of people advise you to start your day with the biggest hardest task. For me that's often a recipe for disaster. &lt;strong&gt;A big, hard task is a chance to get distracted&lt;/strong&gt;. Then I feel worse about myself, and I spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting my day with a small win is a good way to remind myself that being productive feels good. Sometimes I'll also knock out a low priority task first just because it seems fun. Because fuck it, I'm my own boss, and it's okay to enjoy that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;embrace-minimalism&quot;&gt;Embrace minimalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing the visual clutter in my world is a must. My brain constantly feels busy and out of control. &lt;strong&gt;Visual order in my surroundings help to soothe that feeling of chaos.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism also serves a practical purpose for people with ADHD. Every thing that occupies my plane of view is a chance to get distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've been meaning to finish this book, I'll skim through and try to find my place... Oh I forgot about these grip trainers, I really ought to get back into rock climbing... Charger! Dammit Andrew you came over here to charge your phone!! That was the whole point... god I need to do my dishes, but first let me sweep...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for digital minimalism. Notifications are a rabbit hole. Fun looking icons are a rabbit hole. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is a potential rabbit hole&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working on making my phone dumb again. First, I removed all of the social apps. Then I turned off notifications for everything except a few apps I use to communicate with my friends. I even turned off the notification bubbles on my email app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.andrewaskins.com/content/images/2019/05/phone.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;My phone
&lt;h3 id=&quot;raise-money&quot;&gt;Raise money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of bootstrapping. I love the conversations the bootstrapped community has around health and entrepreneurship. This group of people is bucking the idea that you have to build something massive and work yourself to the bone in order to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But raising money has one underrated advantage. It lights one hell of a fire under your ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raising money has one underrated advantage... it lights one hell of a fire under your ass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a bootstrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's only partially true. When we started the company, my co-founders and I had been trying to get something off the ground for several months. Then we got accepted into an accelerator program. They put $16,000 into our company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.andrewaskins.com/content/images/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-05-at-6.15.20-PM.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The email where I found out we were getting $16,000 to start Krit. 
&lt;p&gt;While it wasn't much, without that money our company wouldn't exist today. &lt;strong&gt;It held us accountable&lt;/strong&gt;. It gave us the pressure we needed to get started. That's a powerful feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hire-a-coach-or-editor-&quot;&gt;Hire a coach (or editor)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising money won't always be an option, so you'll have to find other ways to hold yourself accountable. &lt;strong&gt;Start by figuring out what excites and motivates you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it's people and relationships. The surest way for me to get something done, is to know that I will be letting someone down if I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital we raised was the first example. But a more accessible option is to hire a coach. Or, if you're a writer, hire an editor. Regular meetings with another person are a fantastic forcing function. I may get the work I promised them done the day before our meeting, but I'm going to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-work-you-enjoy&quot;&gt;Do work you enjoy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone should be lucky enough to find work they enjoy. But &lt;strong&gt;for those with ADHD it's a requirement if you want to be successful&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my career as a programmer. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of it, but I hated cranking out code day after day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I wasn't very productive as a programmer. I regularly missed deadlines, and the quality of my code was average at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest boost for my productivity was stepping away from writing code full-time. Two years ago I transitioned from coding to a more traditional CEO role. I handle sales, marketing and whatever needs doing on a daily basis. I'm much happier than I was when I was programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was privileged enough to be in a position where, at 23, I was running my own company. Because of that position I was able to change my role without getting a new job, or anyone's permission. For that I am incredibly lucky (and thankful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not in that position, it will be harder to experiment and find the work you love. But &lt;strong&gt;if you have ADHD, you have to try&lt;/strong&gt;. Like every other tip here, it's about reducing the chances of getting distracted. When you enjoy the work, it becomes easier to get started, and you're less likely to look for distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
Listening to this podcast about chasing your motivation was super affirming for me.
&lt;p&gt;Finding working you enjoy isn't a magic cure-all. I still have to do things I don't want to do. I still have to constantly work on my self-discipline. But it is leaps and bounds better now than it was just a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-advantages-of-adhd&quot;&gt;The advantages of ADHD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disorder also has advantages. &lt;strong&gt;The biggest advantage of ADHD is the ability it gives me to think creatively.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds vague, so let me try to explain. I'm horrible at completing simple, repetitive tasks. I'm terrible at time management, and conceptualizing time in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the types of tasks that the world puts into the bucket of &quot;creative&quot; I tend to be quite good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ Thinking up names for new products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ Creating a high level strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ Figuring out the perfect wording for a company goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ Writing (when I can get started)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ Persuasive conversations (aka sales)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ Solving poorly-defined or murky problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all things I can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have no proof that ADHD is the cause, there have been studies that indicate it is connected to creative thinking. And from my own anecdotal evidence it holds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note on medication: When I take medication I feel these skills being dulled. I can't think as quickly, I'm not as outgoing. ADHD medication also contributes to an increase in anxiety, and so for me it's not worth it. If you're struggling you should absolutely try it. For some people, medication is a must. Don't ever feel bad about taking it if it helps you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't ever want to use ADHD as an excuse or a crutch.&lt;/strong&gt; But if I don't acknowledge the challenges the disorder creates I can't develop coping mechanisms. So I'm acknowledging those challenges and I'm sharing them here. My hope is that others facing the same challenges know they're not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I don't acknowledge the challenges the disorder creates I can't develop coping mechanisms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what works for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight shame&lt;/strong&gt;. It's an asshole of an emotion. Don't let it rule your life. You're not a bad person just because you have done bad things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a way to &lt;strong&gt;create healthy pressure&lt;/strong&gt;. Raise money or hire a coach. Whatever it is, invest time learning what motivates you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize obsessively&lt;/strong&gt;. Lists, lists, lists. Don't overcomplicate it to start, a blank sheet of paper works great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start small&lt;/strong&gt;. Look for a small win to start your day off and build momentum from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace minimalism&lt;/strong&gt; in your digital and physical life. The fewer visual triggers to distract you the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the work you love.&lt;/strong&gt; The internet has created a new world where any niche can turn into a sustainable profession. Worry about the finances later, focus on finding work you enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember, like everything in life ADHD is a two-sided coin. The disorder that drives you crazy is likely responsible for some of the best parts of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin up, you got this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final note: It took me 4 months of leaving this piece half finished and coming back to it in order to finish it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>How I run a company with ADHD</og:title>
<og:description>For the first 19 years of my life I was convinced I was lazy. Then I was diagnosed with ADHD. I've since started a company and grown it to a team of 8. Here's how I've learned to not just cope, but embrace the disorder.</og:description>

<title>Facebook sues analytics firm Rankwave over data misuse</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/facebook-rankwave-lawsuit/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/facebook-rankwave-lawsuit/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Facebook might have another Cambridge Analytica on its hands. In a late Friday news dump, &lt;span&gt;Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/05/enforcing-our-platform-policies/&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that today it filed a lawsuit alleging South Korean analytics firm &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rankwave.com/&quot;&gt;Rankwave&lt;/a&gt; abused its developer platform’s data, and has refused to cooperate with a mandatory compliance audit and request to delete the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s lawsuit centers around Rankwave offering to help businesses build a Facebook authorization step into their apps so they can pass all the user data to Rankwave, which then analyzes biographic and behavioral traits to supply user contact info and ad targeting assistance to the business. Rankwave also apparently misused data sucked in by its own consumer app for checking your social media “influencer score”. That app could pull data about your Facebook activity such as location checkins, determine that you’ve checked into a baseball stadium, and then Rankwave could help its clients target you with ads for baseball tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of a seemingly fun app to slurp up user data and repurpose it for other business goals is strikingly similar to how Cambridge Analytica’s personality quiz app tempted millions of users to provide data about themselves and their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TechCrunch-Facebook-Rankwave-Lawsuit.pdf&quot;&gt;TechCrunch has attained a copy of the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that alleges that Rankwave misused Facebook data outside of the apps where it was collected, purposefully delayed responding to a cease-and-desist order, claimed it didn’t violate Facebook policy, lied about not using its apps since 2018 when they were accessed in April 2019, and then refused to comply with a mandatory audit of its data practices. Facebook Platform data is not supposed to be repurposed for other business goals, only for the developer to improve their app’s user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By filing the lawsuit, we are sending a message to developers that Facebook is serious about enforcing our policies, including requiring developers to cooperate with us during an investigation” Facebook’s director of platform enforcement and litigation Jessica Romero wrote. Facebook tells TechCrunch that “To date Rankwave has not participated in our investigation and we are trying to get more info from them to determine if there was any misuse of Pages data.” We’ve reached out to Rankwave for its response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter wp-image-1826004&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Facebook-Rankwave-Lawsuit.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Facebook-Rankwave-Lawsuit.png 1046w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Facebook-Rankwave-Lawsuit.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Facebook-Rankwave-Lawsuit.png?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Facebook-Rankwave-Lawsuit.png?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Facebook-Rankwave-Lawsuit.png?resize=680,489 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Facebook-Rankwave-Lawsuit.png?resize=50,36 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cambridge Analytic-ish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s lawsuit details that “Rankwave used the Facebook data associated with Rankwave’s apps to create and sell advertising and marketing analytics and models — which violated Facebook’s policies and terms” and that it “failed to comply with Facebook’s requests for proof of Rankwave’s compliance with Facebook policies, including an audit.” Rankwave apparently accessed data from over thirty apps, including those created by its clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Facebook cites that its “Platform Policies largely restrict Developers from using Facebook data outside of the environment of the app, for any purpose other than enhancing the app users’ experience on the app.” But Rankwave allegedly used Facebook data outside those apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1826046&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1826046&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-1826046&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Rank.cloud-data-extraction.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;308&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Rank.cloud-data-extraction.png 1977w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Rank.cloud-data-extraction.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Rank.cloud-data-extraction.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Rank.cloud-data-extraction.png?resize=768,348 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Rank.cloud-data-extraction.png?resize=680,308 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Rank.cloud-data-extraction.png?resize=50,23 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1826046&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Rankwave describes how it extracts contact info and ad targeting data from Facebook data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s suit claims that “Rankwave’s B2B apps were installed and used by businesses to track and analyze activity on their Facebook Pages . . . Rankwave operated a consumer app called the ‘Rankwave App.’ This consumer app was designed to measure the app user’s popularity on Facebook by analyzing the level of interaction that other users had with the app user’s Facebook posts. On its website, Rankwave claimed that this app calculated a user’s ‘Social influence score’ by ‘evaluating your social activities’ and receiving ‘responses from your friends.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch has found that Rankwave still offers an &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rankwave&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;Android app&lt;/a&gt; that asks for you to login with Facebook so it can assess the popularity of your posts and give you a “Social Influencer Score”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/28/facebook-api-shut-down/&quot;&gt;Until 2015 when Facebook tightened its policies&lt;/a&gt;, this kind of app could ingest not only a user’s own data but that about their Facebook friends. As with Cambridge Analytica, this likely massively compounded Rankwave’s total data access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1826044&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1826044&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1826044 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-App.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-App.png 1116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-App.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-App.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-App.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-App.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-App.png?resize=50,29 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1826044&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Rankwave’s Android app asks for users’ Facebook data in exchange for providing them a Social Influencer Score&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Delays Coming After Rankwave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2012 by Sungwha Shim, Rankwave came into Facebook’s crosshairs in June 2018 after it was sold to a Korean entertainment company in May 2017. Facebook assesses that the value of its data at the time of the buyout was $9.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, Facebook didn’t reach out to Rankwave until January 2019 for information proving it complied with the social network’s policies. After receiving no response, Facebook issued a cease-and-desist order in February, which Rankwave replied to seeking more time because it’s CTO had resigned, which Facebook calls “false representations”. Later that month, Rankwave denied violating Facebook’s policies but refused to provide proof. Facebook gave it more time to provide proof, but Rankwave didn’t respond. Facebook has now shut down Rankwave’s apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1826064&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1826064&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1826064 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Targeting-Data.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;365&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Targeting-Data.png 1352w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Targeting-Data.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Targeting-Data.png?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Targeting-Data.png?resize=768,412 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Targeting-Data.png?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rankwave-Targeting-Data.png?resize=50,27 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1826064&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Rankwave claims to be able to extract a wide array of ad targeting data from Facebook data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Facebook is seeking money to cover the $9.8 million value of the data, additional monetary damages and legal fees, plus injunctive relief restraining Rankwave from accessing the Facebook Platform, requiring it to comply with Facebook’s audit, requiring that it delete all Facebook data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Rankwave was openly promoting these services that blatantly violate Facebook’s policies casts further doubt on how the social network was policing its platform. And the six month delay between Facebook identifying a potential issue with Rankwave and it even reaching out for information, plus another several months before it blocked Rankwave’s app shows a failure to move swiftly to enforce its policies. These blunders might explain why Facebook buried the news by announcing it on a Friday afternoon when many reporters and readers have already signed off for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now there’s no evidence of wholesale transfer of Rankwave’s data to other parties or its misuse for especially nefarious purposes like influencing an election as with Cambridge Analytica. The lawsuit merely alleges data was wrongly harnessed to make money, which may not spur the same level of backlash. But the case further proves that Facebook was too busy growing itself thanks to the platform to properly safeguard it against abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can learn more about Rankwave’s analytics practices from this 2014 presentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Senate Testimony on Privacy Rights and Data Collection in a Digital Economy</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://idlewords.com/&quot;&gt;Idle Words&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://idlewords.com/talks/&quot;&gt;Talks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt; Privacy Rights and Data Collection in a Digital Economy (Senate hearing)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;776.51170966521&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to address you today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the founder and sole employee of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in&quot;&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt;, a small for-profit archiving service founded in 2009 that competes in part on the basis of personal privacy. I have also been a frequent critic of Silicon Valley’s reliance on business models requiring mass surveillance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/talks/&quot;&gt;speaking on the topic&lt;/a&gt; at conferences both in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who earns his living through data collection, I am acutely aware of the power the tools we are building give us over our fellow citizens’ private lives, and the danger they pose to our liberty. I am grateful to Chairman Crapo, ranking member Brown, and the committee for the opportunity to testify on this vital matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet economy in 2019 is dominated by five American tech companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are also the five most valuable corporations in the world, with a combined market capitalization exceeding four trillion dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between them, these companies control the market for online advertising, mobile and desktop operating systems, office software, document storage, search, cloud computing, and many other areas of the digital economy. They also own and operate a significant portion of the physical infrastructure of the internet, and act as its &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; regulating authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concentration of power in the hands of these giant firms is the epilogue to a spectacular story of American innovation and dynamism. The technologies underpinning the internet were all developed here in the United States, and the many fortunes that they produced owe their thanks to fruitful cooperation between government, industry, and the research community. Working together, the public and private sectors created the conditions for a startup culture unlike any other in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, however, that culture of dynamism is at risk. The surveillance business model has eroded user trust to such a point that it is impeding our ability to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the five internet giants operate like sovereign states. Their operations are global, and decisions they take unilaterally can affect entire societies. Denmark has gone so far as to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/04/denmarks-tech-ambassador-thinks-silicon-valley-could-learn-a-few-things-from-his-country/&quot;&gt;send an ambassador to Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. When Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, met recently with the Canadian prime minister, the occasion was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-canada-trudeau-amazon-com/canadas-trudeau-to-meet-amazon-ceo-bezos-during-u-s-visit-idUSKBN1FR2KT&quot;&gt;covered in the press like a state visit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of this tech oligopoly reflects a profound shift in our society, the migration of every area of commercial, social, and personal life into an online realm where human interactions are mediated by software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To an extent that has no precedent, the daily activities of most Americans are now tracked and permanently recorded by automated systems. It is likely that every person in this hearing room carries with them a mobile phone that keeps a history of their location, is privy to their most private conversations, and contains a rich history of their private life. Some of you may even have an always-on microphone in your car or home that responds to your voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging technologies promise to afford these systems even more intimate glimpses into our private lives—phones that monitor our facial expressions as we read, and connected homes that watch over us while we sleep. Scenarios that were once the province of dystopian dime fiction have become an unremarkable consumer reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden ubiquity of this architecture of mass surveillance, and its enshrinement as the default business model of the online economy, mean that we can no longer put off hard conversations about the threats it poses to liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to this urgency is the empirical fact that, while our online economy depends on the collection and permanent storage of highly personal data, we do not have the capacity to keep such large collections of user data safe over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litany of known data breaches is too long to recite here, but includes every one of the top five tech companies, as well as health and financial firms and government agencies. Every year brings new and more spectacular examples of our inability to protect our users. At Yahoo, an internet giant at the time with a world-class security team, over 3 billion user accounts were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/technology/yahoo-hack-3-billion-users.html&quot;&gt;compromised in a 2013 breach&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, the US Office of Personnel Management allowed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach&quot;&gt;unauthorized access to the records of over four million people&lt;/a&gt;, including many with highly sensitive security clearances. And in 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifax#May%E2%80%93July_2017_data_breach&quot;&gt;Equifax exposed data&lt;/a&gt;, including social security numbers, on 147 million Americans, nearly half the US population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many individual data breaches are due to negligence or poor practices, their overall number reflects an uncomfortable truth well known to computer professionals—that our ability to attack computer systems far exceeds our ability to defend them, and will for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation, therefore, is not tenable. The internet economy today resembles the earliest days of the nuclear industry. We have a technology of unprecedented potential, we have made glowing promises about how it will transform the daily lives of our fellow Americans, but we don’t know how to keep its dangerous byproducts safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing privacy in the context of regulation can be vexing, because the companies doing the most to erode our privacy are equally sincere in their conviction that they are its champions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confusion stems from two different ways in which we use the word privacy, leading us to sometimes talk past each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the regulatory context, discussion of privacy invariably means data privacy—the idea of protecting designated sensitive material from unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laws like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act&quot;&gt;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&lt;/a&gt; (HIPAA) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley_Act&quot;&gt;Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&lt;/a&gt; (GLBA) delimit certain categories of sensitive information that require extra protection, and mandate ways in which health and financial institutions have to safeguard this data, or report when those safeguards have failed. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&quot;&gt;Children's Online Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1998 extends similar protection to all data associated with children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to use this framework of data privacy today, including in the recently enacted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; (GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that, when it comes to protecting specific collections of data, the companies that profit most from the surveillance economy are the ones working hardest to defend them against unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a second, more fundamental sense of the word privacy, one which until recently was so common and unremarkable that it would have made no sense to try to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the idea that there exists a sphere of life that should remain outside public scrutiny, in which we can be sure that our words, actions, thoughts and feelings are not being indelibly recorded. This includes not only intimate spaces like the home, but also the many semi-private places where people gather and engage with one another in the common activities of daily life—the workplace, church, club or union hall. As these interactions move online, our privacy in this deeper sense withers away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, even people living in a police state could count on the fact that the authorities didn’t have enough equipment or manpower to observe everyone, everywhere, and so enjoyed more freedom from monitoring than we do living in a free society today. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A characteristic of this new world of ambient surveillance is that we cannot opt out of it, any more than we might opt out of automobile culture by refusing to drive. However sincere our commitment to walking, the world around us would still be a world built for cars. We would still have to contend with roads, traffic jams, air pollution, and run the risk of being hit by a bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while it is possible in principle to throw one’s laptop into the sea and renounce all technology, it is no longer be possible to opt out of a surveillance society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about privacy in this second, more basic sense, the giant tech companies are not the guardians of privacy, but its gravediggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension between these interpretations of what privacy entails, and who is trying to defend it, complicates attempts to discuss regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech companies will correctly point out that their customers have willingly traded their private data for an almost miraculous collection of useful services, services that have unquestionably made their lives better, and that the business model that allows them to offer these services for free creates far more value than harm for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers will just as rightly point out that they never consented to be the subjects in an uncontrolled social experiment, that the companies engaged in reshaping our world have consistently refused to honestly discuss their business models or data collection practices, and that in a democratic society, profound social change requires consensus and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further complicating the debate on privacy is the novel nature of the data being collected. While the laws around protecting data have always focused on intentional communications—documents that can be intercepted, conversations that can be eavesdropped upon—much of what computer systems capture about us is behavioral data: incidental observations of human behavior that don’t seem to convey any information at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral data encompasses anything people do while interacting with a computer system. It can include the queries we type into a search engine, our physical location, the hyperlinks we click on, whether we are sitting or standing, how quickly we scroll down a document, how jauntily we walk down a corridor, whether our eyes linger on a photo, whether we start to write a comment and then delete it—even the changes in our facial expression as we are shown an online ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incidental data has proven to be such a valuable raw material that an entire industry now specializes in finding ways to mine it. The devices used to spy on us include our computers, cell phones, televisions, cars, security cameras, our children’s toys, home appliances, wifi access points, even at one point &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/brave-new-garbage-londons-trash-cans-track-you-using-1071610114&quot;&gt;trash cans in the street&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which anyone consents—or can consent—to this kind of tracking is the thorny question in attempting to regulate the relationship between people and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; (GDPR), enacted in May of 2018, is the most ambitious attempt thus far to regulate online privacy. It takes a very traditional view of the relationship between people and data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of the GDPR, people own their data. They make an affirmative choice to share their data with online services, and can revoke that choice. The consent they give must be explicit and limited to a specified purpose—the recipient does not have carte blanche to use the data as they please, or to share it with third parties, with some complicating caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have the right to request a full download of their data from the services they have entrusted it to, and they have the right to demand that it be permanently erased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR imposes a notification requirement for data breaches, and requires affirmative consent for the sale of user data. It also restricts the movement of data to outside jurisdictions (though in the case of the United States, this restriction is superseded by the US-EU Privacy Shield framework).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the GDPR mandates that privacy safeguards like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security)&quot;&gt;data tokenization&lt;/a&gt; and encryption be built in to new systems, and that companies appoint a dedicated privacy officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR is not a simple regulation, and many of its most potentially significant provisions (such as the scope of a data controller’s ‘legitimate interests’, or what the right to erasure means in the context of a machine learning model) await interpretation by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What limits, if any, the GDPR will place on the application of machine learning is a particularly important open question. The law on its face prohibits automated decision making that has a “legal or similarly significant effect” on data subjects, but the definition of “significant effect” is not clear, nor is it clear whether having a human being simply countersign an algorithmic decision would be enough to satisfy regulators that the decision process is not fully automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is so new, the GDPR’s ultimate impact on online privacy in the EU is unclear. Some of the dramatic early impacts (like major US newspapers &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/25/gdpr-claims-its-first-victims-u-s-newspapers/&quot;&gt;going offline&lt;/a&gt;) have proven to be transient, while many of the biggest impacts hinge on future decisions by EU regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough has happened, however, to draw some preliminary conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR so far has made life hard on internet users. It is not clear that this is the GDPR’s fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plain language of the GDPR is so plainly at odds with the business model of surveillance advertising that contorting the real-time ad brokerages into something resembling compliance has required acrobatics that have left essentially everybody unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading ad networks in the European Union have chosen to respond to the GDPR by stitching together a sort of Frankenstein’s monster of consent, a mechanism whereby a user wishing to visit, say, a weather forecast page is first prompted to agree to share data with a consortium of 119 entities, including the aptly named “A Million Ads” network. The user can scroll through this list of intermediaries one by one, or give or withhold consent en bloc, but either way she must wait a further two minutes for the consent collection process to terminate before she is allowed to find out whether or not it is going to rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This majestically baroque consent mechanism also hinders Europeans from using the privacy preserving features built into their web browsers, or from turning off invasive tracking technologies like third-party cookies, since the mechanism depends on their being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the average EU citizen, therefore, the immediate effect of the GDPR has been to add friction to their internet browsing experience along the lines of the infamous 2011 EU Privacy Directive (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002&quot;&gt;EU cookie law&lt;/a&gt;”) that added consent dialogs to nearly every site on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR rollout has also demonstrated to what extent the European ad market depends on Google, who has assumed the role of de facto technical regulatory authority due to its overwhelming market share. Google waited until the night before the regulation went into effect to announce its intentions, leaving ad networks scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is significant that Google and Facebook also took advantage of the US-EU privacy shield to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/19/facebook-moves-15bn-users-out-of-reach-of-new-european-privacy-law&quot;&gt;move 1.5 billion non-EU user records&lt;/a&gt; out of EU jurisdiction to servers in the United States. Overall, the GDPR has significantly strengthened Facebook and Google at the expense of smaller players in the surveillance economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data protection provisions of the GDPR, particularly the right to erase, imposed significant compliance costs on internet companies. In some cases, these compliance costs just show the legislation working as intended. Companies who were not keeping adequate track of personal data were forced to retrofit costly controls, and that data is now safer for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in other cases, companies with a strong commitment to privacy also found themselves expending significant resources on retooling. Personally identifying information has a way of seeping in to odd corners of computer systems (for example, users will sometimes accidentally paste their password into a search box), and tracking down all of these special cases can be challenging in a complex system. The requirements around erasure, particularly as they interact with backups, also impose a special burden, as most computer systems are designed with a bias to never losing data, rather than making it easy to expunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final, and extremely interesting outcome of the GDPR, was an inadvertent experiment conducted by the New York Times. Privacy advocates have long argued that intrusive third-party advertising does not provide more value to publishers than the traditional pre-internet style of advertising based off of content, but there has never been a major publisher willing to publicly run the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times tested this theory by &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/gumgumtest-new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/&quot;&gt;cutting off all ad networks in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and running only direct sold ads to its European visitors. The paper found that ad revenue increased significantly, and stayed elevated into 2019, bolstering the argument that surveillance-based advertising offers no advantage to publishers, and may in fact harm them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is too soon to draw definitive conclusions about the GDPR, there is a tension between its concept of user consent and the reality of a surveillance economy that is worth examining in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key assumption of the consent model is any user can choose to withhold consent from online services. But not all services are created equal—there are some that you really can’t say no to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the example of Facebook. Both landlords and employers in the United States have begun &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/09/creepy-startup-will-help-landlords-employers-and-online-dates-strip-mine-intimate-data-from-your-facebook-page/&quot;&gt;demanding to see Facebook accounts as a condition of housing or employment&lt;/a&gt;. The United States Border Patrol has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/23/2016-14848/agency-information-collection-activities-arrival-and-departure-record-forms-i-94-and-i-94w-and#h-11&quot;&gt;made a formal request&lt;/a&gt; to begin collecting social media to help vet people arriving in the country. In both those contexts, not having a Facebook account might stand out too much to be a viable option. Many schools now communicate with parents via Facebook; Facebook groups are also the locus for political organizing and online activism across the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogous arguments can be made for social products offered by the other major tech companies. But if you can’t afford to opt out, what does it mean to consent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opting out can also be impossible because of how deeply the internet giants have embedded themselves in the fabric of the internet. For example, major media properties in the EU use a technology called ReCaptcha on their GDPR consent forms. These forms must be completed before a user can access the website they are gathering consent for, but since the ReCaptcha service is run by Google, and the form cannot be submitted without completing the Google-generated challenge (which incidentally performs free image classification labor for the company), a user who refuses to give Google access to her browser will find herself denied access to a large portion of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this specific example may change when it comes to the attention of an EU regulator, the broader issue remains. The sheer reach of the tech oligopoly makes it impossible to avoid using their services. When a company like Google controls the market-leading browser, mobile operating system, email service and analytics suite, exercises a monopoly over search in the EU, runs the largest ad network in Europe, and happens to &lt;a href=&quot;https://broadbandnow.com/report/google-content-providers-submarine-cable-ownership/&quot;&gt;own many of the undersea cables&lt;/a&gt; that connect Europe to the rest of the world, how do you possibly say ‘no’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond one’s basic ability to consent, there is the question of what it means to give informed consent. Presumably we are not opting in or out of the services we use for capricious reasons, but because we can make a rational choice about what is in our interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, however, obtaining this information is not possible, even assuming superhuman reserves of patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, anyone visiting the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr blogging platform&lt;/a&gt; from a European IP address must first decide whether to share data with Tumblr’s 201 advertising partners, and read five separate privacy policies from Tumblr’s several web analytics providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a domain expert in the field, and spending an hour clicking into these policies, I am unable to communicate what it is that Tumblr is tracking, or what data of mine will be used for what purposes by their data partners (each of whom has its own voluminous terms of service). This opacity exists in part because the intermediaries have fought hard to keep their business practices and data sharing processes a secret, even in the teeth of strong European regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Advertising_Bureau&quot;&gt;Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe&lt;/a&gt; (IABE) defeat the spirit of the GDPR by bundling consent and requiring it across many ad-supported properties in Europe. If regulators block the bundling in its current incarnation, it will no doubt rise from the dead in a modified form, reflecting the undying spirit of surveillance advertising. But at no point will internet users have the information they would need to make a truly informed choice (leaving aside the ridiculousness of requiring a legal education and two hours of sustained close reading in order to watch a cat video).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a sense in which machine learning and the power of predictive inference may be making the whole idea of consent irrelevant. At this point, companies have collected so much data about entire populations that they can simply make guesses about us, often with astonishing accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A useful analogy here is a jigsaw puzzle. If you give me a puzzle with one piece missing, I can still assemble it, reconstruct the contours of the missing piece by looking at the shape of the pieces around it and, if the piece is small compared to the whole, easily interpolate the missing part of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what computer systems do to us when we deny them our personal information. Experts have long known that it takes a very small amount of data to make reliable inferences about a person. Most people in the United States, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf&quot;&gt;can be uniquely identified&lt;/a&gt; by just the combination of their date of birth, gender, and zip code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But machine learning is honing this ability to fill in the blanks to surprising levels of accuracy, raising troubling questions about what it means to have any categories of protected data at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine that an algorithm could inspect your online purchasing history and, with high confidence, infer that you suffer from an anxiety disorder. Ordinarily, this kind of sensitive medical information would be protected by HIPAA, but is the inference similarly protected? What if the algorithm is only reasonably certain? What if the algorithm knows that you’re healthy now, but will suffer from such a disorder in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is not hypothetical—&lt;a href=&quot;https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0110-z&quot;&gt;a 2017 study&lt;/a&gt; showed that a machine learning algorithm examining photos posted to the image-sharing site Instagram was able to detect signs of depression before it was diagnosed in the subjects, and outperformed medical doctors on the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradigm of automatic ownership of personal data does not mesh well with a world where such private data can not only interpolated and reconstructed, but independently discovered by an algorithm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I can infer such important facts about your life by applying machine learning to public data, then I have deprived you of privacy just as effectively as I would have by direct eavesdropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to talk meaningfully about consent in online systems, the locus of regulation will need to expand beyond data collection, to cover how those data collections, and the algorithms trained on them, are used. But to do this, we will first need far greater visibility into the workings of surveillance-dependent tech companies than they have so far been willing to grant us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands, the consent framework exemplified in the GDPR is simply not adequate to safeguard privacy. As much as we would like to be the masters of our data, we are not. And the real masters aren’t talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absent a clear understanding of how our data is being used, and the role it plays in surveillance-based business models, it is hard to lay out a specific regulatory program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are some general goals we can pursue based on the experience of regulation attempts in Europe, and what we know about the surveillance economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy regulation should be understandable, both for users of the technology, and for the companies the regulations govern. Users especially should not be required to make complex and irrevocable decisions about privacy. To the extent possible, intuitions about privacy from the human world (“a casual conversation between friends is not recorded forever”) should carry over into the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the risk of sounding tautological, privacy regulation should not punish people for seeking privacy. It should not be necessary to turn on invasive tracking technologies in one’s browser in order to express the desire to not to be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that we lack the capacity to keep data collections safe over time, we can reduce the potential impact of any breach by setting strict lifetimes for behavioral data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/automatically-delete-data/&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; that users will be able to set their account to automatically delete location data after three or 18 months. This demonstrates that permanent retention of behavioral data is not critical to surveillance-based business models. Such limits should be enforced industrywide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to a norm where behavioral data is kept briefly instead of forever will mark a major step forward in data security, both reducing the time data is potentially exposed to attackers, and reducing the total volume of data that must be kept safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time limits on behavioral data will also reduce consumers’ perception that they are making irrevocable privacy commitments every time they try a new product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right to download is one of the most laudable features in the GDPR, and serves the important secondary purpose of educating the public about the extent of data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This right should, however, be expanded to include the right to download, and correct, all information that third-party data brokers have provided about a user, in a spirit similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act&quot;&gt;Fair Credit Reporting Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech startups in the highly regulated areas of health, finance and banking should be required to compete on the same regulatory footing as established businesses in those areas. In particular, they should not be allowed to do an end run around existing data privacy laws by using machine learning and algorithmic inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the use of a machine learning algorithm should not allow a loan company to evade consumer protections against discrimination in fair lending laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For a fuller discussion of this point, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm#addendum&quot;&gt;addendum on machine learning&lt;/a&gt; at the end of this document).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above suggestions seek to impose limits and restrictions, there is an important way that privacy regulation can create new ground for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is missing from the regulatory landscape is a legal mechanism for making credible and binding promises to users about privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, internet startups in the U.S. who want to compete on privacy have no mechanism to signal their commitment to users other than making promises through their terms of service (which usually include a standard legal clause that they may change at any time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except in the case of the most egregious violations, which sometimes attract the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, these terms of service carry little weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the owner of a company that markets itself to privacy-conscious people, I would derive enormous benefit from a legal framework that allowed me to make binding privacy promises (for example, a pledge that there is no third-party tracking on my website), and imposed stiff fines on my company if I violated these guarantees (including criminal liability in the case of outright fraud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a legal mechanism would not only enable competition around privacy-enhancing features, but it would also give future regulators a clearer idea of how much value consumers place on data privacy. It is possible that the tech giants are right, and people want services for free, no matter the privacy cost. It is also possible that people value privacy, and will pay extra for it, just like many people now pay a premium for organic fruit. The experiment is easy to run—but it requires a modest foundation in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic research in computer science is full of fascinating ideas that could serve as the seed for business built around user privacy. Results in fields like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption&quot;&gt;homomorphic encryption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy&quot;&gt;differential privacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/dropoutlabs/privacy-preserving-machine-learning-2018-a-year-in-review-b6345a95ae0f&quot;&gt;privacy-preserving machine learning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof&quot;&gt;zero-knowledge proofs&lt;/a&gt; all await a clever entrepreneur who can incorporate them into a useful product or service. It is very hard to compete against companies like Amazon or Facebook on price, but it is not hard to beat them on privacy. With a minimum of regulatory scaffolding, we might see a welcome new burst of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final, and paramount goal, of privacy regulation should be to preserve our liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no clearer warning of the danger of building up an infrastructure of surveillance than what is happening today in China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Claiming to be concerned about the possible radicalization of a Muslim minority, Chinese authorities have imposed a regime of total surveillance over a population of twenty-five million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass-surveillance&quot;&gt;recent reporting by Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; has shown, a computer system called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) monitors the location and movement of all people in the province (based on phone data), as well as their gas and electricity consumption, which apps they use, where they worship, who they communicate with, and how they spend their money. This surveillance information is fed into machine learning models that can bin people into one of thirty-six suspect categories, bringing them to the closer attention of the police. Never before has a government had the technical means to implement this level of surveillance across an entire population. And they are doing it with the same off-the-shelf commercial technologies we use in America to get people to click on ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latent potential of the surveillance economy as a toolkit for despotism cannot be exaggerated. The monitoring tools we see in repressive regimes are not ‘dual use’ technologies—they are single use technologies, working as designed, except for a different master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sixty years, we have called the threat of totalitarian surveillance ‘Orwellian’, but the word no longer fits the threat. The better word now may be ‘Californian’. A truly sophisticated system of social control, of the kind being pioneered in China, will not compel obedience, but nudge people towards it. Rather than censoring or punishing those who dissent, it will simply make sure their voices are not heard. It will reward complacent behavior, and sideline troublemakers. It’s even possible that, judiciously wielded, such a system of social control might enjoy wide public support in our own country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I hope you will agree with me that such a future would be profoundly un-American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no deep reason that weds the commercial internet to a business model of blanket surveillance. The spirit of innovation is not dead in Silicon Valley, and there are other ways we can grow our digital economy that will maintain our lead in information technology, while also safeguarding our liberty. Just like the creation of the internet itself, the effort to put it on a safer foundation will require a combination of research, entrepreneurial drive and timely, enlightened regulation. But we did it before, and there’s no reason to think we can’t do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning&quot;&gt;Machine learning&lt;/a&gt; is a mathematical technique for training computer systems to make accurate predictions from a large corpus of training data, with a degree of accuracy that in some domains can mimic human cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, machine learning algorithms trained on a sufficiently large data set can learn to identify objects in photographs with a high degree of accuracy, transcribe spoken language to text, translate texts between languages, or flag anomalous behavior on a surveillance videotape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathematical techniques underpinning machine learning, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network&quot;&gt;convolutional neural networks&lt;/a&gt; (CNN), have been well-known since before the revolution in machine learning that took place beginning in 2012. What enabled the key breakthrough in machine learning was the arrival of truly large collections of data, along with concomitant computing power, allowing these techniques to finally demonstrate their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes data sets of millions or billions of items, along with considerable computing power, to get adequate results from a machine learning algorithms Before the advent of the surveillance economy, we simply did not realize the power of these techniques when applied at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because machine learning has a voracious appetite for data and computing power, it contributes both to the centralizing tendency that has consolidated the tech industry, and to the pressure companies face to maximize the collection of user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models poses some unique problems in privacy regulation because of the way they can obscure the links between the data used to train them and their ultimate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key feature of machine learning is that it occurs in separable phases. An initial training phase consists of running a learning algorithm on a large collection of labeled data (a time and computation-intensive process). This model can then be deployed in an exploitation phase, which requires far fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the training phase is complete, the data used to train the model is no longer required and can conceivably be thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two phases of training and exploitation can occur far away from each other both in space and time. The legal status of models trained on personal data under privacy laws like the GDPR, or whether data transfer laws apply to moving a trained model across jurisdictions, is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspecting a trained model reveals nothing about the data that went into it. To a human inspecting it, the model consists of millions and millions of numeric weights that have no obvious meaning, or relationship to human categories of thought. One cannot examine an image recognition model, for example, and point to the numbers that encode ‘apple’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training process behaves as a kind of one-way function. It is not possible to run a trained model backwards to reconstruct the input data; nor is it possible to “untrain” a model so that it will forget a specific part of its input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms are best understood as inference engines. They find structure and excel at making inferences from data that can sometimes be surprising even to people familiar with the technology. This ability to see patterns that humans don’t notice has led to interest in using machine learning algorithms in medical diagnosis, evaluating insurance risk, assigning credit scores, stock trading, and other fields that currently rely on expert human analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opacity of machine learning models, combined with this capacity for inference, also make them an ideal technology for circumventing legal protections on data use. In this spirit, I have previously referred to machine learning as “money laundering for bias”. Whatever latent biases are in the training data, whether or not they are apparent to humans, and whether or not attempts are made to remove them from the data set, will be reflected in the behavior of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final feature of machine learning is that it is curiously vulnerable to adversarial inputs. For example, an image classifier that correctly identifies a picture of a horse might reclassify the same image as an apple, sailboat or any other object of an attacker’s choosing if they can &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08864.pdf&quot;&gt;manipulate even one pixel&lt;/a&gt; in the image. Changes in input data not noticeable to a human observer will be sufficient to persuade the model. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731518309183&quot;&gt;Recent research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that this property is an inherent and ineradicable feature of any machine learning system that uses current approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, machine learning is effective, has an enormous appetite for data, requires large computational resources, makes decisions that resist analysis, excels at finding latent structure in data, obscures the link between source data and outcomes, defies many human intuitions, and is readily fooled by a knowledgeable adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

These guides might help you after you have the basics figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BMW, Audi, Volvo, and Mercedes all use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlexRay&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FlexRay&lt;/a&gt; and can be supported after &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/463&quot;&gt;FlexRay support&lt;/a&gt; is merged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We put time into a Ford port, but the steering has a 10 second cutout limitation that makes it unusable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2016-2017 Honda Accord uses a custom signaling protocol for steering that's unlikely to ever be upstreamed.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>During Cold War, CIA Plucked Soviet Submarine from Ocean Floor Using Giant Claw</title>
<link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/during-cold-war-ci-secretly-plucked-soviet-submarine-ocean-floor-using-giant-claw-180972154/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/during-cold-war-ci-secretly-plucked-soviet-submarine-ocean-floor-using-giant-claw-180972154/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In a corner exhibit of the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C., which opens this weekend, a submarine control panel, a swoopy-banged wig, detailed whiteprints and a chunk of manganese are on display. Together, they represent relics of a Cold War espionage mission so audacious, the museum’s curator, Vince Houghton, compares it to the heist from &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s 11.&lt;/em&gt; This mission, codenamed Project Azorian, involved the C.I.A. commissioning the construction of a 600-foot ship to retrieve a sunken Soviet submarine from the ocean floor—all in complete secrecy. “I can’t imagine there’s another country in the world that would have thought, ‘We found a Soviet submarine, under [more than three miles] of water. Let’s go steal it,’ says Houghton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six-year mission began in 1968, when the Soviet ballistic missile submarine &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; went missing without explanation somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. In this post-Cuban Missile Crisis era, both American and Soviet submarines prowled the open seas with nuclear weapons aboard, prepared for potential war. Some reports indicate that the sinking was due to a mechanical error such as inadvertent missile engine ignition, while the Soviets for a time &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20000822/aponline135027_000.htm&quot;&gt;suspected&lt;/a&gt; the Americans of foul play. After two months, the Soviet Union abandoned its search for &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; and the nuclear weapons it carried, but the United States, which had recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=BWpHb3dgJe4C&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; Air Force technology to locate two of its own sunken submarines, pinpointed the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; 1,500 miles northwest of Hawaii and 16,500 feet below the surface. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb305/doc01.pdf&quot;&gt;declassified C.I.A. history&lt;/a&gt; of the project, “No country in the world had succeeded in raising an object of this size and weight from such a depth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, the intelligence community deliberated about the cost-to-reward ratio of such an expensive and risky undertaking even as the submarine offered a tantalizing trove of information. According to Houghton, the value of the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; stemmed not just from the code books and nuclear warheads onboard, but also the chance to understand the manufacturing process behind the rival power’s submarines. If the U.S. knew how the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt;’s sonar systems operated, or the mechanisms by which the submarines kept quiet, they could improve their ability to detect them. And by 1967, the Soviet Union had amassed an armament of nuclear weapons large enough that the two nations had “virtual nuclear parity,” Houghton explains. As a result, the Americans were hungry to gain a competitive advantage—an edge the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; might provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C.I.A. brainstormed several improbable-sounding means of recovering the submarine. One suggestion involved generating enough gas on the ocean floor to buoy the submarine to the surface. Instead, they settled on an idea reminiscent of the classic arcade game—a giant claw that would grasp and pull the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; into the “moon pool” belly of a giant ship. Initially, the project boasted an estimated ten percent chance of success. (Granted, that figure increased as Azorian approached completion.)&lt;/p&gt;

In the bottom-center of the ship, you can see the plans for the &quot;moon pool,&quot; which the claw would be able to pull the submarine into. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Courtesy of the International Spy Museum)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Azorian diagram&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/11Po1CvWcEHF4wDDS_4ldejOZlw=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/65/7e/657efedb-b0dc-4eda-9afe-744b798b0cce/azorian-diagram.png&quot;/&gt; A diagram of Project Azorian's retrieval mechanism on display at the International Spy Museum &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Courtesy of the International Spy Museum)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legally speaking, the U.S. was concerned that the project could leave them open to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2017.1342344&quot;&gt;charges of piracy&lt;/a&gt; if the Soviets had an inkling of the illicit submarine-salvaging plans. Wanting to sidestep diplomatic tensions and keep whatever knowledge was to be gleaned from the mission secret, the C.I.A. constructed an elaborate cover story with the help of enigmatic billionaire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/06/archives/howard-hughes-dies-at-70-on-flight-to-texas-hospital-billionaire.html&quot;&gt;Howard Hughes&lt;/a&gt;. The aviation mogul lent his imprimatur to the construction of the 618-foot-long ship, to be named the &lt;em&gt;Hughes Glomar Explorer,&lt;/em&gt; which was advertised as a deep-sea mining research vessel. In 1972, a champagne christening ceremony and fabricated press release celebrated the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ship first sailed from Pennsylvania to waters near Bermuda for testing in 1973, the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; noted the occasion, calling the vessel “shrouded in secrecy” and observing, “Newsmen were not permitted to view the launch, and details of the ship’s destination and mission were not released.” Evidently, the public and press chalked the mystery up to Hughes’ reputation as a recluse, such a loner that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/14/archives/howard-hughes-beyond-the-law-trying-to-apply-orderly-legal.html&quot;&gt;was said&lt;/a&gt; to eschew even his own company’s board meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt; navigated to the Pacific around South America—because it was too wide to pass through the Panama Canal. After some minor foibles (the U.S.-assisted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/eyewitness-account-pinochets-coup-45-years-ago-180970241/&quot;&gt;1973 Chilean coup&lt;/a&gt; happened the same day as seven technicians were trying to board the ship in the country’s port city of Valparaíso), the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt; arrived in Long Beach, California, where it loaded more than 20 vans full of equipment (including a darkroom, paper processing, nuclear waste handling) for analyzing the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt;’s contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a team built the claw (nicknamed “Clementine” and formally known as the “capture vehicle”) in a gargantuan floating barge called &lt;em&gt;HMB-1&lt;/em&gt; in Redwood City. In the spring of 1974, &lt;em&gt;HMB-1&lt;/em&gt; submerged and met up with the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt; off the coast of Catalina Island in southern California. &lt;em&gt;HMB-1&lt;/em&gt; opened its roof, and the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt; opened the bottom of its hollow “moon pool” to take the steel claw onboard. Then the &lt;em&gt;HMB-1&lt;/em&gt; detached and returned to Redwood City, the transfer unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;HMB1&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/c--_A5TyoXPJ1iRW3nymhFK_Y5o=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/78/cf/78cf9a42-11cb-46d7-ae59-5f8f9a96bfc4/gettyimages-515403524.jpg&quot;/&gt; The 51,000-ton barge &lt;em&gt;HMB-1&lt;/em&gt; was where the &quot;capture vehicle&quot; that would grasp the submarine was constructed in secret. Here, &lt;em&gt;HMB-1&lt;/em&gt; sails under the Golden Gate Bridge. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Bettman / Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer, the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt;, with the approval of President Richard Nixon, set off towards the spot where the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; rested. By this point, the Cold War had reached a &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/detente&quot;&gt;détente&lt;/a&gt;, but still, two separate Soviet ships (likely loaded with intelligence operatives) closely monitored the supposed mining vessel as it worked to retrieve the submarine. (At one point, &lt;em&gt;Glomar&lt;/em&gt; crew members even piled crates on their landing deck to prevent any attempts to land a helicopter.) But the mission continued undetected—as the 274 pieces of heavy steel pipe that stretched between the claw and the ship were being slowly hauled back onboard, with the submarine in Clementine’s grasp, the second Soviet tug sailed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a week of slow upward progress, Project Azorian finally completed the lift of the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt;—but only one part of it. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2LuCITP&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project AZORIAN: The CIA and the Raising of the K-129&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; a book co-written by naval historian Norman Polmar and documentary director Michael White, about midway through the process, a few of the grabber arms encircling the submarine broke, and a large part of the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; fell back to the ocean floor. While the later media reports and history books generally relayed that the more desirable components of the submarine, like the code room, sunk, Houghton encourages skepticism of the details surrounding the project’s ostensible failure. “The conventional wisdom has become that this was a failed mission,” he explains. “[The C.I.A. has] allowed that belief to be what everyone understands, but why would they not? I always say, ‘We have no idea what they got.’” (Many of the details in this story are sourced from C.I.A. declassified documents and recently published historical accounts, but since other findings from the mission are still classified, and the C.I.A. may have had reason to obfuscate the story, skepticism remains warranted.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do know, however, that the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt; retrieved the bodies of several of the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt;’s crewmembers, whom they gave a military burial at sea, which the C.I.A. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJAJUJ41PBI&quot;&gt;filmed&lt;/a&gt; and gave to Russia almost 20 years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/09/18/549535352/how-the-cia-found-a-soviet-sub-without-the-soviets-knowing&quot;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;. Coincidentally, the retrieval also brought up manganese samples from the bottom of the sea, the material that the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt; purportedly was researching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. seemed to have gotten away with the elaborate submarine heist—Ford’s secretary of defense, James Schlesinger, said in a White House meeting, “The operation is a marvel.” In early 1975, however, after a random robbery of the headquarters of Hughes’ Summa Corporation, which was acting as a front for the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt;, the story made its way to the headlines of the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; and national television. The story broke later than it could have—famed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter Seymour Hersh had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/19/archives/cia-salvage-ship-brought-up-part-of-soviet-sub-lost-1968-failed-to.html?module=ArrowsNav&amp;amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;amp;action=keypress&amp;amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot;&gt;following it&lt;/a&gt; as early as 1973 but honored a request from C.I.A. director William Colby to suppress the story—and were riddled with inaccuracies. (The code name was thought to be “Jennifer,” which was actually referred only to its security procedures, and the &lt;em&gt;L.A. Times&lt;/em&gt; report placed the recovery efforts in the Atlantic Ocean.) Nonetheless, it was enough to alert the Soviet Union and “disturb” (his words) President Ford. Project Matador, the plan to retrieve the rest of the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt;, apparently got nixed as news of the thought-to-have-failed mission and its rumored (but, Houghton says, ultimately unknowable) $300 million-plus price tag circulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C.I.A. also faced a diplomatic dilemma that spring. Pressed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2017.1342344&quot;&gt;Soviet ambassador to the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and Freedom of Information Act requests from journalists, they wanted to avoid directly acknowledging that they’d illicitly stolen a submarine from the watchful Soviets, but were obligated to somehow respond. “[The U.S. government] did not want to embarrass the Soviets,” Houghton says, “mainly because in doing so, [they] really set diplomacy back significantly, because the Soviet premier would have to respond” through sanctions or an attack on a territory. In the effort to walk this diplomatic tightrope and comply with FOIA requirements, the “Glomar response”—“we can neither confirm nor deny”—was coined. While the Glomar response &lt;a href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/phillippi-v-central-intelligence-agency&quot;&gt;stood up in federal court&lt;/a&gt; as a reason to deny a FOIA request, the incident, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2017.1342344&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; historian M. Todd Bennett, “intensified otherwise routine ‘Intelligence Wars,’ tit-for-tat actions taken by the Soviet and American intelligence services.” That May, Soviet operatives increased the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509929/&quot;&gt;microwave radiation&lt;/a&gt; trained on the American embassy in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-picture=&quot;&quot; data-alt=&quot;The wig Vernon Walters, the deputy director of the C.I.A., used to disguise himself when he visited the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Glomar Explorer&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/h50p8xv0KltUCCrpSG6hCNqhePs=/1024x596/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/6e/68/6e685ba5-24b0-42f6-aa32-75591a4ec616/image2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The wig Vernon Walters, the deputy director of the C.I.A., used to disguise himself when he visited the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Glomar Explorer&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty-five years after the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt; hauled (part of) the &lt;em&gt;K-129&lt;/em&gt; from the ocean floor, Project Azorian remains “legendary within the [intelligence] community,” Houghton says. The glass cases show the onesies worn by crew members onboard, phony belt-buckle “safety awards,” a barometer from the ship and even a wig C.I.A. deputy director Vernon Walters wore to pay the &lt;em&gt;Glomar Explorer&lt;/em&gt; an incognito visit, but they also name-check engineer John Graham and display a scaled-down version of the detailed whiteprint used to design the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2015/09/09/former-cia-spy-ship-hughes-glomar-explorer-sold-for-scrap&quot;&gt;now-defunct&lt;/a&gt; ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azorian stands out, Houghton says, because “it’s so bold, so ambitious, and it almost was guaranteed to fail.” And yet, although only part of the submarine was retrieved, the ship was built, the almost ridiculous proposition of a giant claw extending to the ocean floor proved functional, and despite the scale of the project, it stayed secret for seven years. The Spy Museum positions the Azorian saga as a paean to innovation, an exemplar of how the “unsolvable problems” of the intelligence world can be tackled with creativity and technological advances.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>They Were Promised Coding Jobs in Appalachia</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;BECKLEY, W.Va. — On a spring day in 2017, Stephanie Frame sat down in her hilltop home deep in the mountain hollows to record a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She began with the litany of local decline: the vanishing jobs in the coal mines, the shuttering stores, the school that closed down. During one stretch of unemployment for her coal miner husband, the two had resorted to selling ramps, ginseng and yellowroot that they had dug up in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But this video, aimed at her neighbors, was an announcement: Redemption was here. A nonprofit called &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.minedminds.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mined Minds&lt;/a&gt;, promising to teach West Virginians how to write computer code and then get them good-paying jobs, was looking for recruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I wholeheartedly believe, and will always believe,” Ms. Frame said to the camera, “that God has sent Mined Minds to us to save us from what could have been a very bleak future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She had every reason to believe. Joe Manchin III, her Democratic senator, had invited the group to come into the state. The National Guard hired it to teach at its military-style academy. County commissioners arranged space rent free. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/out-of-work-coal-miners-find-new-work-in-computer-industry/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National news outlets&lt;/a&gt; gave glowing coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many West Virginians like Ms. Frame signed up for Mined Minds, quitting their jobs or dropping out of school for the prized prospect of a stable and lucrative career. But the revival never came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Almost none of those who signed up for Mined Minds are working in programming now. They described Mined Minds as an erratic operation, where guarantees suddenly evaporated and firings seemed inevitable, leaving people to start over again at the bottom rungs of the wage jobs they had left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Over two dozen former students in West Virginia are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.register-herald.com/news/nonprofit-being-accused-of-failure-to-properly-train-pay-appalachians/article_44959aec-07b0-5791-a5a1-89d49550b426.html&quot; title=&quot;lawsuit&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pursuing a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that Mined Minds was a fraud. Out of the 10 or so people who made it to the final weeks of Ms. Frame’s class in Beckley, only one formally graduated. He is now delivering takeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It was a too-good-to-be-true kind of deal,” said Billyjack Buzzard, 33, who attended another class and was the only former West Virginia coal miner to finish classes and get a job with the program. He was fired after 14 months and went back underground. “Just false hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mined Minds came into Appalachia espousing a certain dogma, fostered in the world of start-ups and TED Talks, and carried with missionary zeal into places in dire need of economic salvation. The group was premised on the notion, as one grant proposal read, that “anyone can have a successful career in the technology industry,” and that if enough people did, the whole area would be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amanda Laucher, one of the founders of Mined Minds, spoke at a tech conference in 2017 of the group’s ambitions, which were swiftly expanding. “Yeah, we helped a town, we actually made some small impact,” she said of Mined Minds’ early efforts. “But can we scale it and actually diversify the economy of an entire region?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This would be an audacious goal even in the best of circumstances. But Mined Minds was operating with a limited amount of personal cash and public funding, and was mostly staffed by people who had spent little time in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Laucher now acknowledges that while she is still committed to the group’s mission, the work has not been easy. “Progress is difficult,” she said in an email, “with the current atmosphere in Appalachia which is deeply interested in maintaining a ‘culture.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She blamed the opioid epidemic and “the poverty culture” of the region, mentioning “Hillbilly Elegy,” the best-selling memoir by J.D. Vance, who, like Ms. Laucher, went from working-class Rust Belt roots to success in the tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She added: “There are generations of hard work ahead. We’ll be only a tiny force working toward change in the area I grew up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;None of this — neither the experience itself nor Ms. Laucher’s thoughts about its difficulties — strikes some former students as surprising. This is, they say, how things tend to go in Appalachia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I get angry at people who go to other places and say, ‘My culture is better than theirs and I am going to change it,’” said Katie Bolyard, 25, a college graduate who skipped her honeymoon to take a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She doesn’t know the motives of the people at Mined Minds, she said, whether they had bad intentions or were just “incredibly sloppy” with good ones. But intentions only matter so much. “It’s not your life you’re messing with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-872od7 eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-5ccf10fa&quot;&gt;‘They All Find a Job’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Before the founding of Mined Minds, Ms. Laucher and her husband, Jonathan Graham, were living in Chicago working as successful tech consultants. But in 2015, she learned that her younger brother, Marvin, had been laid off from a mine back in the coalfields of southwest Pennsylvania where she grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was stuck in the Appalachian dilemma: technologically savvy, as modern miners have to be, but stuck with few options. So Mr. Graham and Ms. Laucher quit their jobs and moved to Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The model for Mined Minds, at least initially, was this: a free 16-week coding boot camp, followed by paid “apprenticeships” with the program’s for-profit arm, a software consultancy. Apprentices worked full-time on projects for company clients, but were also called upon to teach in the classes they had graduated from months earlier. After working for a few months, apprentices would either go on to salaried jobs at the Mined Minds company, or to a big tech firm such as Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Every single one of them” finds work, Ms. Laucher said of the boot camp graduates, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/02/20/innovative-program-designed-to-help-coal-miners-switch-careers/&quot; title=&quot;Laucher interview&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in a 2017 interview&lt;/a&gt;. “They all find a job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A guarantee like that was barely short of miraculous. Within two years, Mined Minds was one of the primary beneficiaries of a $1.5 million grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission. In August 2016, Mr. Manchin, who encouraged the couple to expand from Pennsylvania, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wvgazettemail.com/opinion/u-s-senator-joe-manchin-mined-minds-teaches-miners-a/article_8ec3389d-7b16-53ea-bdcb-adc90d8de385.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that Mr. Graham and Ms. Laucher “embody the spirit of West Virginia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the spring of 2017, Tori Frame, Stephanie Frame’s daughter, was making $10 an hour as an assistant manager at a Family Dollar store when she learned about Mined Minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I didn’t want to be stuck in Gauley Bridge, W.Va., my whole life working at Family Dollar,” said Tori, 23. “I wanted something different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Others viewed Mined Minds the same way. Andrew Farley figured he could quickly make the pay scale in coding that he made working for the railroad, but without having to leave his hometown; Chris Phelps, who washed dishes at a Cracker Barrel, thought a tech career was a way to get out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ty Cook, 29, a bank teller, saw something more, “something that would make me a worthwhile member of society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And there was an irresistible promise: They would be paid to take the class. Some were told this in an email by a state jobs counselor, others said they were told by Ms. Laucher. The counselor said in an email they would receive $10 an hour, with the potential for more as apprentices or when they were hired. A number of people, including Tori, quit their jobs. (Ms. Laucher has denied making any such promise.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In late June 2017, a big crowd gathered in a classroom at a small college campus in Beckley. They met Marvin Laucher, Ms. Laucher’s brother, the former coal miner, now their main instructor. They also learned that they were not going to be paid. Some dropped out the first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Tori and her mother, Stephanie, 45, stayed. Every weekday morning, Tori would wake up early, her mother would feed the chickens and together they would head down the serpentine mountain road to Beckley. Nights and weekends they spent in the glow of their laptops — bought from a website on credit — learning the rudiments of Ruby, the programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;“I didn’t want to be stuck in Gauley Bridge, W.Va., my whole life working at Family Dollar,” said Tori Frame, 23. “I wanted something different.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andrew Spear for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There was never much of a syllabus; students would be given an assignment and spend the next few days trying to figure it out, mostly by themselves. The usual answer to questions, multiple students said, was “Google it.” A few quietly wondered how much their teachers really knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Unease began to settle in among some of the students. They began to learn from their teaching assistants, graduates of a recent Mined Minds class, that the good stable jobs promised by the group were not nearly as stable as they appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Firings and resignations were routine among the staff. One of the Beckley teaching assistants, a 33-year-old named Maxx Turner, had already been fired, then rehired after several fruitless months of searching for programming work, he said. Some began to suspect that the program couldn’t afford the job guarantee it was advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Money woes did not make sense, given what they saw of the founders’ lifestyle: the travels worldwide, the views from an office in Chicago’s Trump Tower, the ever-replenishing tequila bottles at the West Virginia headquarters, the boozy house parties in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Several former Mined Minds staff members described company gatherings the same way: Their bosses ordering seemingly endless shots, hectoring the more timid drinkers. “I thought by going out drinking with them I’d put myself in a better position,” said Michael Moore, 35, the other teaching assistant in Beckley, who dropped out of community college to take the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The promised 16-week class went on 17 weeks. Then 18, then 19. As the class continued, many students began to run out of money. Out of the more than two dozen students who began, about 10 were left by late October, some playing computer games in class to pass the time, just waiting for the final project before graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-872od7 eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-10a8eeca&quot;&gt;A Fateful Trip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Early on, Ms. Laucher had suggested the project would be something for the community, maybe a gaming app addressing the opioid epidemic. Then the project was finally announced: the design of a website for a pet bed-and-breakfast that Ms. Laucher’s mother was opening in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Stephanie Frame was still a believer. When word spread of a trip by the Mined Minds leadership to a tech conference in Lithuania in November, she saw an opportunity. She had never been out of the country, but this was a way to lock in a job, for her and for her daughter. Her husband agreed to spend $1,000 on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If I could hang with them,” she remembered thinking, “be one of them, show them how dedicated I am, how much I supported them, then we’ve got it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While Stephanie and others were in Lithuania, the rest of the class was debating whether to stick it out to graduation. A news station in Pennsylvania had reported on problems with the Mined Minds program there, including that nearly all the graduates of one class had been fired right after being hired as apprentices. The state of Pennsylvania ordered Mined Minds to cease operations for not having a license to run a school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On a morning in late November, in the first class after the Lithuania conference, the students in Beckley arrived to a shocking development. Two people who had gone on the trip — Stephanie Frame and Mr. Moore, their teaching assistant — had been kicked out of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a video conference, Ms. Laucher told the class that Stephanie had been dismissed because of “extreme sexual harassment, lots of drunkenness, basically behaving in a way that we wouldn’t condone at Mined Minds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Stephanie was stunned. She thought the trip had been successful. She had gotten very drunk, she said, but no one on the trip had mentioned anything like “extreme sexual harassment.” Mr. Moore said he had seen nothing like the harassment Ms. Laucher described, and that in any case, everyone had been drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He would later be told that he was being dismissed for being belligerent one night of the trip, and also of having a drug problem — a charge, he said, easily refuted by years of clean drug tests — including one for Mined Minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As Ms. Laucher shared the news, other students were angry, and suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Even in the moment I’m hearing this I’m thinking, ‘O.K., this isn’t adding up,’” Mr. Phelps said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Bolyard wondered whether Mined Minds simply couldn’t afford the apprenticeships. “They were just making excuses to get rid of people,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tori’s parents told her to just finish the class, but she couldn’t. She sent a formal resignation letter, citing broken promises and a “party culture” that turned her off. Nearly all of the other students, infuriated by the whole thing, followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-872od7 eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-25e158c5&quot;&gt;‘It Repeats Itself’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mined Minds has continued operating, holding new classes in Logan, another hard-luck coal town in West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In mid-April of this year, Ms. Laucher reprimanded five employees for not making enough networking connections on LinkedIn, for neglecting to read a book she had assigned, “The Start-Up of You,” and for not submitting their résumés to her for help. The next day, all five were fired. The staff of the program in West Virginia, two of those former employees said, now consists of Ms. Laucher’s brother and sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And several weeks ago, Ms. Laucher announced on social media that she had been accepted to law school in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Asked if this was the end of Mined Minds, Ms. Laucher wrote: “Absolutely not. Still going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since the class in Beckley ended, Stephanie Frame has mostly stayed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As she recounted her experience with Mined Minds in her living room, her husband, Roger, just off work, sat down and listened. It’s always the same here, he finally said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They’re coming here promising stuff that they don’t deliver,” said Mr. Frame, his hands and face still gray with coal dust. “People do that all the time. They’ve always done it to Appalachians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He recalled the pittance his great-grandparents sold their mineral rights for, and what they got from it: the coal company tearing down mountains and building roads wherever it wanted. Timber, coal, oil and gas, “it repeats itself,” he said. “It’s like a never-ending cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Members of the Beckley class still keep in touch on a private chat group they call “Disenfranchised Appalachians.” Nearly everyone they had worked alongside has quit or been fired, though some said they had learned a lot from their work at Mined Minds. One, usually described as the program’s clear success, found a programming job in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Stephanie’s daughter Tori, who had begun dating Ty Cook from the class, went back to the Family Dollar, starting over as a cashier. Over the next year, she worked her way up to become manager, a promotion that, Ms. Laucher said in a recent deposition for the lawsuit, was evidence of “the logic and problem solving skills that came with Mined Minds training.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A couple of months ago, however, Tori found a job at a call center in Columbus, Ohio. In late February, she and Mr. Cook packed their belongings in a trailer and left West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Use links not keys to represent relationships in APIs</title>
<link>https://cloudblog.withgoogle.com/products/application-development/api-design-why-you-should-use-links-not-keys-to-represent-relationships-in-apis/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cloudblog.withgoogle.com/products/application-development/api-design-why-you-should-use-links-not-keys-to-represent-relationships-in-apis/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The primary difference is that the relationships are expressed using links, rather than foreign key values. In these examples, the links are expressed using simple JSON name/value pairs (see the section below for a discussion of other approaches to writing links in JSON).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that the inverse relationship of the pet to its owner has been made explicit by adding the &quot;pets&quot; field to the representation of Joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing &quot;id&quot; to &quot;self&quot; isn't really necessary or significant, but it’s a common convention to use &quot;self&quot; to identify the resource whose attributes and relationships are specified by the other name/value pairs in the same JSON object. &quot;self&quot; is the name &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml&quot;&gt;registered at IANA&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewed from an implementation point of view, replacing all the database keys with links is a fairly simple change—the server converted the database foreign keys into URLs so the client didn't have to—but it significantly simplifies the API and reduces the coupling of the client and the server. Many URI templates that were essential for the first design are no longer required and can be removed from the API specification and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server is now free to change the format of new URLs at any time without affecting clients (of course, the server must continue to honor all previously-issued URLs). The URL passed out to the client by the server will have to include the primary key of the entity in a database plus some routing information, but because the client just echoes the URL back to the server and the client is never required to parse the URL, clients do not have to know the format of the URL. This reduces coupling between the client and server. Servers can even obfuscate their URLs with base64 or similar encoding if they want to emphasize to clients that they should not make assumptions about URL formats or infer meaning from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, I used a relative form of the URIs in the links, for example /people/98765. It might have been slightly more convenient for the client (although less convenient for the formatting of this blog post), if I had expressed the URIs in absolute form, e.g., https://pets.org/people/98765. Clients only need to know the standard rules of URIs defined in the IETF specifications to convert between these two URI forms, so which form you choose to use is not as important as you might at first assume. Contrast this with the conversion from foreign key to URL described previously, which requires knowledge that is specific to the pet store API. Relative URLs have some advantages for server implementers, as described below, but absolute URLs are probably more convenient for most clients, which is perhaps why Google Drive and GitHub APIs use absolute URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, using links instead of foreign keys to express relationships in APIs reduces the amount of information a client needs to know to use an API, and reduces the ways in which clients and servers are coupled to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Here are some things you should think about before using links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many API implementations have reverse proxies in front of them for security, load-balancing, and other reasons. Some proxies like to rewrite URLs. When an API uses foreign keys to represent relationships, the only URL that has to be rewritten by a proxy is the main URL of the request. In HTTP, that URL is split between the address line (the first header line) and the host header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an API that uses links to express relationships, there will be other URLs in the headers and bodies of both the request and the response that would also need to be rewritten. There are a few different ways of dealing with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;11.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't rewrite URLs in proxies. I try to avoid URL rewriting, but this may not be possible in your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proxy, be careful to find and map all URLs wherever they appear in the header or body of the request and response. I have never done this, because it seems to me to be difficult, error-prone, and inefficient, but others may have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write all links relatively. In addition to allowing proxies some ability to rewrite URLs, relative URLs may make it easier to use the same code in test and production, because the code does not have to be configured with knowledge of its own host name. Writing links using relative URLs with a single leading slash, as I showed in the example above, has few downsides for the server or the client, but it only allows the proxy to change the host name (more precisely, the parts of the URL called the scheme and authority), not the path. Depending on the design of your URLs, you could allow proxies some ability to rewrite paths if you are willing to write links using relative URLs with no leading slashes, but I have never done this because I think it would be complicated for servers to write those URLs reliably. Relative URLs without leading slashes are also more difficult for clients to use—they need to use a standards-compliant library rather than simple string concatenation to handle those URLs, and they need to be careful to understand and preserve the base URL. Using a standards-compliant library to handle URLs is good practice for clients anyway, but many don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using links may also cause you to re-examine how you do API versioning. Many APIs like to put version numbers in URLs, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Recycling Doesn&amp;#039;t Work</title>
<link>https://thewalrus.ca/why-recycling-doesnt-work/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thewalrus.ca/why-recycling-doesnt-work/</guid>
<description>&lt;span&gt;Illustration by Ricky Leung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;ost Canadians&lt;/span&gt; know the ritual: check the pickup schedule, sort the waste items, clean the jars, make sure the junk mail isn’t stained with coffee grounds. Then fill up the blue box (or blue bag, or blue cart, depending on the city), and on the appointed day, haul it to the curb. It’s an activity that Canadians have participated in eagerly for almost thirty years. Of the three Rs drilled into our heads in school—reduce, reuse, recycle—recycling is the only one that most of us regularly practise. In 2011, according to a survey by Stewardship Ontario, three-quarters of Ontarians considered the weekly act of sorting and disposing as their “primary environmental effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as much as Canadians love the blue box, “its role in [our] hearts and minds…is much larger than its actual environmental impact,” wrote Dianne Saxe, Ontario’s environmental commissioner, in a report last October. In fact, recycling is one of the least environmentally friendly “environmental” things one can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being picked up, enormous volumes of recyclable waste are unloaded at a local materials-recovery facility (&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;MRF&lt;/span&gt;, pronounced like “smurf”), dumped onto conveyor belts, and passed through a battery of sieves, magnets, optical sorters, and manual workers who separate each item into its own stream—plastic, paper, metal, and so on. The batches from each stream are then sent to gigantic balers, squeezed into cubes, and sold, often by middleman companies, to “end markets.” These are the manufacturers, in Canada and around the world, that profit from turning our waste into something new—toilet paper, perhaps, or plastic lawn furniture, egg cartons, or drywall. More than a public service, recycling is largely a commodity business, as dependent on supply and demand as any other. When municipalities produce more recyclable garbage than end markets can absorb, the value of the product decreases, and in the selling market, Canada faces competition from countries across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations of a market-driven system mean that, once industrial- and commercial-waste streams are factored in, about two-thirds of Canadian waste still ends up in landfills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps us feel better about the waste we produce: according to one estimate, 850 kilograms of garbage, per capita, every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot; in-content1 dynamic-widget widget doubleclick_widget-3 widget_doubleclick_widget&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;hen they&lt;/span&gt; were first introduced, blue boxes on Canadian driveways and sidewalks seemed almost revolutionary. People were “extremely enthusiastic,” says Dan Hoornweg, a professor at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. They “really wanted to recycle.” But the box came with conditions—an unfortunate compromise between environmentalists, government, and the soft-drink industry that created the perfect conditions for an explosion in litter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-1980s Ontario, after years of arguments with the province, the soft-drink industry agreed to partially subsidize the blue box, which had been invented a few years earlier by a garbage collector in Kitchener, in exchange for being allowed to switch from refillable glass bottles to cheaper, disposable options. The deal helped create one of the world’s most popular residential-recycling programs, which soon began spreading nationwide. But it also gave industry a social licence to create one-time-use packaging—aluminum cans, yogurt containers, those plastic-wrapped cheese-and-cracker kits parents put in kids’ lunch boxes. In a sense, recycling became the preferred method for excusing wastefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, almost two-thirds of Canada’s waste is produced by the industrial, commercial, institutional, and construction-and-demolition sectors—in everything from factories to office buildings—which are serviced by private waste haulers. Unless they can make a profit selling recyclables, which depends on market prices at the time of sale, there’s little incentive for these haulers to recycle. All of this means that you can put your takeout containers and shredded paper into the office recycling bin, but the company that takes it away is under no legal obligation to recycle it. In Toronto, for example, 72 percent of waste material from apartment and condo buildings goes straight to a landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ontario is the only province from which detailed financials are available. In 2016, blue-box collection cost municipalities a total of $347 million, and only about $95 million was recovered from subsequent sales. The rest of the bill was split between the municipality and industry. The idea, early on, was that sales of recyclables on the open market would pay in full for recycling programs. That, of course, never happened. Our blue boxes contain a lot of “lightweight, complicated materials that cost a fortune to recycle,” Saxe says. Whenever a confused resident places an unrecyclable item (say, a plastic-lined takeout coffee cup) into their box, it only aggravates the situation. “You basically end up paying to process [the item] twice,” says Jim McKay, who oversees Toronto’s solid-waste management services: once as recycling, at the &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;MRF&lt;/span&gt;, and once as garbage. In the end, according to Saxe’s report, the blue box diverts only 8 percent of Ontario’s material from landfills. Other provinces, with fewer homes served by curbside pickup, probably recycle even less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residential recycling itself also comes with a significant environmental footprint of its own, especially tied to transportation and carbon emissions. In some circumstances, recycling could actually end up as an environmental liability. “In rural areas you have trucks going half a kilometre between houses picking up recyclables,” Hoornweg says. “It makes no sense.” Once you tally up the emissions associated with picking up products, sorting them at a &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;MRF&lt;/span&gt;, and sending a batch to far-flung end markets, it’s not difficult to imagine that it’s sometimes better to send recycling to the dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot; in-content2 dynamic-widget widget doubleclick_widget-4 widget_doubleclick_widget&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;his january&lt;/span&gt;, China declared war against &lt;em&gt;yang laji&lt;/em&gt; (“foreign garbage”). After decades of purchasing recycling that was cluttered with undesirable objects, such as greasy pizza boxes, the country set strict cleanliness standards for the material it purchases. The announcement sent the global industry into a frenzy: for decades, China had been the end market for more than half of the world’s plastic and paper, which are used as raw materials in Chinese building and manufacturing. Many of the Canadian outfitters that relied on China were left stranded because they couldn’t guarantee the quality of their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects were immediate: exports of plastics and scraps to China fell from 6,700 tonnes in January 2017 to 578 one year later. Paper-scrap exports fell from 53,000 to 15,800 tonnes. Some of that leftover material is finding its way to other foreign markets, mostly in southeast Asia and India. Some of it is ending up in landfills. Halifax has resorted to burning its plastics in waste-to-energy facilities. And, as of this May, Calgary was still storing more than 7,500 tonnes of paper. At that time, the city also hadn’t been able to find buyers for 1,000 tonnes of clamshell plastics—the little containers berries come in. “They’re laminated and covered in adhesive labels,” says Sharon Howland, Calgary’s leader of program management for waste and recycling. “Nobody wants them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s ban forced many of us to confront the realities of a broken system. Canada is good at touting its green conscience; sacrificing comfort, convenience, and habit is a different matter. Yes, Justin Trudeau signed the Paris climate agreement in 2016, promising to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. But still, road pollution in the country is rising. Whenever gas prices drop, oil-sands projects slow down—which could be seen as environmental progress. But we also then buy bigger, less-fuel-efficient cars. And Canada is lagging behind most other industrialized countries when it comes to electric-vehicle purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same problem can be seen with the blue box: we cling to our good intentions, but we seldom carry them out. We have always produced far more garbage than we could offload to end markets. Increasingly, our &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;MRF&lt;/span&gt;s—and our streets, streams, and oceans—are overflowing with waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saxe’s &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Blue Box&lt;/em&gt; report was presented to Ontario’s legislature last fall, as the province was considering a sea change in its approach to garbage: a “circular economy” in which industry would be responsible for products’ post-consumer life and manufacturing would become a closed loop in which as much as possible is reused, in perpetuity, to create new products. But while Ontario passed the Waste Free Ontario Act in 2016, it provides only a guiding framework for this hypothetical future, with very few details and no concrete plan of action. “It’s certainly a great ambition to imagine this path forward,” Saxe says. “But it will clearly be very, very difficult.” The act’s success is entirely dependent on regulations yet to come, making it, at this point, little more than good intentions. Today, with a premier intent on rolling back the previous government’s environmental initiatives (also including the province’s cap-and-trade carbon-pricing measures) a waste-free future looks doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recycling alone will likely never be enough to make up for the garbage we produce. The fight, thirty years ago, to keep Canadians’ fizzy drinks in refillable glass bottles was a good thing to do all along. Making coffee the old-fashioned way is better than cycling through millions of single-use coffee pods. And yet most people who’ve spent their careers in waste management continue to encourage recycling—it’s better than nothing. And Canadians love it because it’s something each and every one of us can control: sort, clean, and carry to the curb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;13b5&quot; id=&quot;13b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;What I gained, lost &amp;amp; learned while working for Microsoft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cba9&quot; id=&quot;cba9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Many people ask — &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;how does a person get into Microsoft? How is the interview? What is it like?&lt;/em&gt; For me it was everything for 3,5 years. Now, 18 months later, I feel ready to share my story and say a real goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34b0&quot; id=&quot;34b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was interning at a marketing agency at the time after prior experience in a startup and was browsing job offers. Still in college at 23 and full of ideas and hopes for the future, I applied, just like that, for a MACH program — Microsoft Academy for College Hires. Recruitment process was long, had several stages and ended with an assessment center. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Fun fact: I was asked a ‘tricky’ question about why are the sewer covers round.&lt;/em&gt; And another, not that fun, but more important fact &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I got a position in the Developer Experience and Evangelism&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Department&lt;/strong&gt; (now CSE? or something else, it evolves all the time…) as an Audience Marketing Manager located in Warsaw, Poland. My role was to get people, especially in small IT companies, to try out Microsoft Azure (responsible for the breadth market). It was 5 years ago, cloud services were a novelty and the press wasn’t that great. I got serious e-mails from entrepreneurs where Microsoft was spelled ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;M$&lt;/em&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;475c&quot; id=&quot;475c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One of the first things I noticed is that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;almost everyone working for Microsoft had this &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;perfect life&lt;/em&gt; — a spouse, kids, nice houses, good cars&lt;/strong&gt;. I wanted that too. Imagining that if I were to stay at this company, my life would become like theirs. (It was one of the illusions I had fallen for immediately, but I’ll get to the shattering reality later…) At that time, I was in a decent relationship myself and decided to take the most out of this chance focusing on my personal growth as well as the professional opportunities Microsoft provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1560&quot; id=&quot;1560&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And it has provided a ton. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I got my first responsibilities and targets on the day 1&lt;/strong&gt;, but I also received a lot of support and training. As a newly hired employee I was participating in MGX (now it’s Inspire?) in Atlanta, had trainings in Amsterdam, Madrid. There were so many interesting people there who I met and self-assured and mean ones as well. It’s a whole spectrum. I was on calls with people from all around the world on a daily basis and I got paid well. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;A dream job&lt;/em&gt;. My team at the time was consisting of i.a. 4 guys, more less my age, with whom I got along very well, so I started spending crazy hours at the office. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;As a person working for DX, I was encouraged to go to conferences, workshops, hackathons, meetups whenever I wanted to and so I did&lt;/strong&gt;. There was a time where I was barely at home. I was excited. I was meeting new, inspiring people and learning so much every day! Meanwhile the First Class travels, taxis, nice hotels and fancy restaurants were spoiling me. This and everyone’s admiration, that I made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*lE6eCwF-IbzYEin22OD-jQ.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;2048&quot; data-height=&quot;1365&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*lE6eCwF-IbzYEin22OD-jQ.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*lE6eCwF-IbzYEin22OD-jQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The conference I co-organized, with Satya Nadella as a keynote speaker
&lt;p name=&quot;d287&quot; id=&quot;d287&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;On the other hand, it wasn’t all so glamorous. Many of the employees didn’t respect me, to them I was a “starlet”, this “stupid, young girl with a diastema” (yep, someone at the office called me that), some were mad that they hired a 23 year old girl instead of a “professional man”. But I was ok with that, I knew I had to prove myself first. What I wasn’t ok with, were the comments about my looks. A few guys working both for Microsoft and Partners were treating me like a cute puppy or telling me they wanted to have sex with me while drunk, but all of it seemed minor and acceptable — I was gettng so much in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c433&quot; id=&quot;c433&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Back home, my partner didn’t share my enthusiasm. He was under the belief we were to start building a home together, but I was barely there. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Twenty something and living my life to maximum, or what I believed was a maximum at that time — working non stop and drinking way too much&lt;/strong&gt;. I remember writing e-mails at 2 a.m. in a club! Even now it doesn’t seem that crazy to me. My lack of self care wasn’t only the alcohol — I gained 10kg (22lb) during the first year. It’s a common thing to gain weight once you’re hired. We laughed about it, it was a standard. Everyone went through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a22&quot; id=&quot;8a22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Time was passing. People were either changing teams or getting fired. It was painful, I actually cried this one time while saying goodbye to one of my team members who was fired without any real explanation. He wasn’t a Full Time Employee, so he got no compensation (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;for those who don’t know — you can be hired in MS either as an FTE, employed by Microsoft — with all the benefits, trips, trainings etc. or as a vendor — through a hiring agency and no privileges that FTEs have&lt;/em&gt;), but no one else seemed to care. I invested so much in this work by this point. I fought fights no one else wanted to pick up. I tried changing things, but I was constantly paying the price — with my health and with my relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;26b9&quot; id=&quot;26b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I went to Burning Man and moved out of the apartment I shared with my boyfriend. Got into an affair at the office, which turned out to be a usual thing. People have gotten into affairs all the time. I heard of a rule: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;if it’s 100 km/80 miles from home, it doesn’t count&lt;/em&gt;. Guys were saying that as a joke, but then were actually caught on cheating. The whole illusion of these &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;‘perfect’ lives&lt;/em&gt; disappeared. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Many were like me, working non stop not finding time for their close ones, although they were able to find partners who seemed ok with that.&lt;/strong&gt; I think this was a moment when I stopped believing in how awesome working at Microsoft was, even though everyone around still seemed so excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8d24&quot; id=&quot;8d24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The atmosphere wasn’t there anymore, things were changing, they were no longer that fun, but I got more interesting responsibilities - meeting and working with the technical community leaders. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I graduated the 2 year MACH program and was rewarded as the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Best Employee&lt;/em&gt; of the department.&lt;/strong&gt; I received a nice bonus and an offer to go to Redmond for a couple of months, for an employee exchange. I also had a 1:1 meeting with the Department Director, who told me that I can’t be a rebel anymore and kind of threatened me that I should be more careful, because Microsoft has provided me a “&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;golden cage”&lt;/em&gt; and if I ever get out, I will have to face a tough reality. Yep, that was the message: you were young and feisty, and that’s cool, but now chill and never think about leaving, because the world outside will eat you alive, ok?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f27e&quot; id=&quot;f27e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Meanwhile my relationship ended, I was miserable, but somehow my career seemed to flourish.&lt;/strong&gt; I got this great opportunity to work in Redmond and have a chance to find myself a position there, so I can be one of the ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;corp&lt;/em&gt;’ employees! How amazing! That’s something most of the people in the field dream of, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

The view from my apartment in Belltown, Seattle
&lt;p name=&quot;708d&quot; id=&quot;708d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I chose a corporate housing apartment in downtown Seattle, got a beautiful place (which was probably the best apartment I will ever live in in my life). Last floor of a fancy building and a balcony with an ocean view. Gorgeous. And then I started work. Huge campus, nice cafeterias, woods, a pond, overwhelming space. Everything seemed great, but… yes, unfortunately there was a but… but &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The people I had on my team, were extremely closed minded. Most of them with many years of experience working in a corporation, so even more closed minded, only caring about their manager’s approval&lt;/strong&gt;. I was devastated. They were the most fake people I have met still to this day. I cannot even explain how terrible it was for me to have to help them, show interest and pretend that I support what they’re doing. You might be thinking — &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;why weren’t you honest with them instead?&lt;/em&gt; I tried. On 1:1 peer conversations, with my manager, with my skip manager, but no one cared and my role was minimised, so at the end I was only doing a 1 Excel file. I am 100% certain that if I played by their rules and acted the way that they did, focusing on politics, I would do great there, but I refused to do that. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I actually cared about my role, I cared about the people we were doing the Connect event for more than for my career and no one seemed to understand that.&lt;/strong&gt; I believe I slowly started to become depressed during this time. I stopped showing up at the office and was basically counting down the days to come back home. I have spent 3 months there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;092e&quot; id=&quot;092e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When I got back, I was really happy for a first couple of days, but then that feeling started to fade fast. I didn’t want to come to the office in Warsaw either. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I was staying home more and more everyday, often not even getting up from bed, just browsing e-mails and checking in on Skype to pretend that I’m working&lt;/strong&gt;. I wish I could say it was a day or two, but it was weeks. I thought about quitting all the time since I came back from Redmond, but I still enjoyed working with the community leaders and it was a part of my job that kept me going.&lt;/p&gt;

CEE MVP Summit, Belgrade, Serbia, march 2017
&lt;p name=&quot;c5af&quot; id=&quot;c5af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There were structural changes on a global level at Microsoft. I told my manager I don’t want any bonus that year, since I was in Redmond, didn’t have that much impact locally and he should reward other people. I didn’t deserve a bonus either, I couldn’t stand my job anymore, but still didn’t have the guts to quit. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;It was ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;a dream job&lt;/em&gt;’, it has given me so much, it took so much from me&lt;/strong&gt;, but I needed a break. In a midst of the changes I asked for a 3 month unpaid leave. Others warned me that it was a bad idea and that it’s not the time, but I just couldn’t take it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;32f5&quot; id=&quot;32f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I ended up receiving 5 weeks off and went to Portugal for a Workaway. It changed me as well as changed the way I perceived life. It gave me the fresh perspective of a minimalistic lifestyle and not needing all the Microsoft benefits and paychecks to be happy. During my vacation I got some signals that I might get fired. My job title at that time was a Technical Evangelist and it was a hoax. I wasn’t great technically, but the official blueprint stated that the team needed more TEs and I had learned to code, so it was given to me. One of the many ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;little white lies&lt;/em&gt;’… Corporate was trying to minimize these local level hoaxes and I respect that, but it meant that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I came back to Warsaw to receive the dismissal papers&lt;/strong&gt;. There was more going on with a new role proposal etc., but I had the best role (for me) there was in Poland and going back to Redmond seemed like the worst nightmare. I signed the papers and cried for more than an hour. From being the best employee one year, to being fired the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8c72&quot; id=&quot;8c72&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The saddest part is, it wasn’t my manager who told me this. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;My manager, who I worked with 3,5 years by then, didn’t even talk to me during this whole process at all&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of the friends I believed I had, all these people I have spent so much time with, immediately became strangers. I didn’t have a goodbye meeting, wasn’t invited to parties anymore. I had been dedicating myself to a job while sacrificing my relationships, myself and only 2 people from Microsoft cared (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;1 of them because we were dating at that time&lt;/em&gt;). The kind words I have heard were from the people outside — the community leaders, who were appreciative and supportive for which I am forever grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1de3&quot; id=&quot;1de3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It wasn’t a ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;golden cage&lt;/em&gt;’ I was in, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;it was a bubble of illusions that popped once I signed my dismissal papers. Illusions of importance, mission, friendships and luxury&lt;/strong&gt;. I found a job fairly easily with a similar salary, where they didn’t expect me to work 24/7. The only thing that really changed for ‘the worse’ is that I’m not Ubering that much and don’t spend money on fancy hotels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5db8&quot; id=&quot;5db8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity Microsoft has given me. For all the trainings, all the experience, all the travels. I wouldn’t be the person I am today if it wasn’t for this organization, but I am even more grateful for being fired. I didn’t have it in me to quit myself and now I am much better + got the compensation money. I’m 28, have learned to put myself first and spent plenty of time on self care, enough to be able to share this publicly and hopefully not to make the same mistakes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d13&quot; id=&quot;4d13&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So... Goodbye Microsoft! It was a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b068&quot; id=&quot;b068&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;P.S. I know there are teams at Microsoft that are different (shout out to VS Code engineering team!), but I just wasn’t lucky enough to work at one ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b69&quot; id=&quot;3b69&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;P.S. 2 Thanks so much for reading my story, I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
