&lt;p name=&quot;269f&quot; id=&quot;269f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;All my biggest regrets as a founder are around not having difficult conversations sooner. I could have helped team members improve faster, fired people with the wrong fit earlier, had so many more productive meetings. I could have created a more open company culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;593a&quot; id=&quot;593a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was guilty of making excuses: ‘It will sort itself out.’; ‘They’ll eventually stop doing it.’; ‘There are more important things to focus on.’ Of course, delaying these conversations always made things worse. And, sometimes, it even led to crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e58b&quot; id=&quot;e58b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Side-Effect of Empathy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59ad&quot; id=&quot;59ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Empathy means tuning in to the feelings of others. Like many founders, I’ve always had a lot of empathy for people — after all, founders focus their lives on understanding the feelings and needs of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1321&quot; id=&quot;1321&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But when it comes to difficult conversations, I’ve found that empathy has a side-effect. I can get so focused on how the conversation might affect the other person’s feelings that I lose sight of why the conversation is needed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e502&quot; id=&quot;e502&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Without a healthy amount of ‘self-empathy’, we often find that our own needs, and the needs of the business, take the passenger’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0f21&quot; id=&quot;0f21&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Nonviolent Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac47&quot; id=&quot;ac47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is an awful name for one of the most powerful communication courses I’ve ever taken. NVC helps you to be honest, without criticising, insulting, or putting down other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c555&quot; id=&quot;c555&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At the core of NVC is a straightforward communication pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;2692&quot; id=&quot;2692&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When ____[observation], I feel ____[emotion] because I’m needing some ____[universal needs]. Would you be able to ____[request]?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e7ee&quot; id=&quot;e7ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;At first glance, this looks easy. But in practice, it’s extremely difficult to pull off. To grasp the complexity, NVC makes some subtle but critical distinctions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;f4d4&quot; id=&quot;f4d4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Observations vs. evaluations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;16d2&quot; id=&quot;16d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Emotions vs. thoughts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9f4a&quot; id=&quot;9f4a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Universal needs vs. strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;79c1&quot; id=&quot;79c1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Requests vs. demands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;2714&quot; id=&quot;2714&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Understanding these nuances is key to handling difficult conversations. Let’s go through each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e811&quot; id=&quot;e811&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;1. Observations vs. evaluations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;4083&quot; id=&quot;4083&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--h3&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--pullquote-em&quot;&gt;‘The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.’ — Jiddu Krishnamurti, Indian Philosopher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e286&quot; id=&quot;e286&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;An observation is something that you actually saw or heard in the past. You can think of it as raw information. The majority of observations fall into two categories: (i) what you heard, e.g., direct quotes, and (ii) what you saw, e.g., visible past behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a2c6&quot; id=&quot;a2c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our brains are hardwired to take raw information and instantly make up a simple story — good or bad, right or wrong, hero or villain. These stories are evaluations and they are very hard to separate from observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2dae&quot; id=&quot;2dae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here are a few examples to illustrate the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;69f8&quot; id=&quot;69f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Evaluation: ‘You are lazy.’ (a character attack)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;315d&quot; id=&quot;315d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Observation: ‘You said that you’d send the document last week and I haven’t received it.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5fad&quot; id=&quot;5fad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Evaluation: ‘Your work is sloppy.’ (a criticism)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3054&quot; id=&quot;3054&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Observation: ‘Three of the numbers in the report were inaccurate.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;eb34&quot; id=&quot;eb34&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Evaluation: ‘You’re always late.’ (a generalisation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2513&quot; id=&quot;2513&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Observation: ‘You arrived ten minutes late to the meeting this morning.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2813&quot; id=&quot;2813&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Evaluation: You ignored me.’ (implied intent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5273&quot; id=&quot;5273&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Observation: ‘I sent you two emails and I haven’t received a response.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;3d6b&quot; id=&quot;3d6b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;An easy way to check whether you’ve made an observation or an evaluation is to ask yourself, ‘What did I actually see or hear?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;180a&quot; id=&quot;180a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;2. Emotions vs. thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6744&quot; id=&quot;6744&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The usual reaction to talking about feelings is, ‘Oh God, really?’ But being aware of, and communicating, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnvc.org/Training/feelings-inventory&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnvc.org/Training/feelings-inventory&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;undefined noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt; has a powerful impact on other people. When a difficult conversation is needed, people often say they feel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4f14&quot; id=&quot;4f14&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Scared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d070&quot; id=&quot;d070&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Annoyed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fc62&quot; id=&quot;fc62&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Anxious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d8aa&quot; id=&quot;d8aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Confused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3f52&quot; id=&quot;3f52&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Embarrassed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4708&quot; id=&quot;4708&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Hurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;84fe&quot; id=&quot;84fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Sad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9b39&quot; id=&quot;9b39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Tired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;f401&quot; id=&quot;f401&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;These words are important because often, what comes after ‘I feel,’ isn’t an emotion — it’s a thought. Compare the following examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;83db&quot; id=&quot;83db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Thought: ‘I feel that you aren’t taking this seriously.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3a4e&quot; id=&quot;3a4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Emotion: ‘I feel frustrated.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;86d8&quot; id=&quot;86d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If you can substitute ‘I feel’ with ‘I think’ and the phrase still works, it’s a thought, not an emotion. And sharing our thoughts in difficult conversations can often get us into trouble, especially if the other person disagrees and wants to correct you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f0bc&quot; id=&quot;f0bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are a few emotions that require extra attention and curiosity before sharing them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2628&quot; id=&quot;2628&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;a) Anger:&lt;/strong&gt; Anger often masks more painful emotions like hurt and shame. It’s important to figure out what’s underneath the anger before having a difficult conversation, because when you’re angry, you’re more likely to speak impulsively and forget NVC altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;988e&quot; id=&quot;988e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;b) Evaluative words:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the phrase, ‘I feel blamed’. Doesn’t it sound a lot like the evaluation, ‘You blamed me’? To reduce the chance of a defensive response like, ‘I didn’t blame you’, NVC asks that you identify the evaluation and recognise how it impacts you emotionally. For example, feeling ‘blamed’ might leave you feeling ‘scared’. Here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/nonviolent/evaluative-words-list-nonviolent-communication&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/nonviolent/evaluative-words-list-nonviolent-communication&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;undefined noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some others:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;8247&quot; id=&quot;8247&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Evaluation: ‘I feel judged.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5e4f&quot; id=&quot;5e4f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Impact: ‘I feel resentful.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;45ce&quot; id=&quot;45ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Evaluation: ‘I feel misunderstood.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;492d&quot; id=&quot;492d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Impact: ‘I feel frustrated.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e40b&quot; id=&quot;e40b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Evaluation: ‘I feel rejected.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e5fe&quot; id=&quot;e5fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Impact: ‘I feel hurt.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;8fba&quot; id=&quot;8fba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;At this stage of the course, I began to realise how bad my emotional literacy was — I found it pretty hard to get past ‘upset’ and ‘pissed off’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9377&quot; id=&quot;9377&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;3. Universal Needs vs. Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dca5&quot; id=&quot;dca5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;NVC asserts that &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;all human beings share the same&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnvc.org/Training/needs-inventory&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnvc.org/Training/needs-inventory&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;undefined noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;universal needs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that behind every negative emotion lies an unmet universal needs. For example, if a certain comment in a meeting left you feeling embarrassed, you might realise that you felt embarrassed because your need for consideration wasn’t being met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a7f5&quot; id=&quot;a7f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The pairing of emotions with universal needs has a transformative effect in difficult conversations. Common universal needs that come up a lot in difficult conversations are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;5572&quot; id=&quot;5572&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Autonomy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e36d&quot; id=&quot;e36d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9fc5&quot; id=&quot;9fc5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;dc1b&quot; id=&quot;dc1b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;f81d&quot; id=&quot;f81d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0b6f&quot; id=&quot;0b6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;83f6&quot; id=&quot;83f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Respect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;1cff&quot; id=&quot;1cff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Reassurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0d8c&quot; id=&quot;0d8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c1bf&quot; id=&quot;c1bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9499&quot; id=&quot;9499&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;2442&quot; id=&quot;2442&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Not everything that follows the words, ‘I need’ is a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt; need. You can say, ‘I need a sandwich,’ but that doesn’t mean sandwiches are a universal need. NVC distinguishes between our universal needs and the strategies that would meet our needs. Eating a sandwich is a strategy to meet your need for hunger. Here’s another example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;3416&quot; id=&quot;3416&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Strategy: ‘I need you to copy me into every email.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;92f8&quot; id=&quot;92f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Universal need: ‘I need some transparency.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;24df&quot; id=&quot;24df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;There’s a subtle but important point to make here. As soon as you include ‘from you’ in the need statement, it stops being universal. Compare the following statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;0daf&quot; id=&quot;0daf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Strategy: ‘I need support from you.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2c49&quot; id=&quot;2c49&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Universal need: ‘I need support.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;8131&quot; id=&quot;8131&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Can you see how the first version could be more easily interpreted as a veiled accusation? ‘You aren’t supporting me,’ is the implication. To minimise the chance of defensiveness, NVC tells us to leave other people out of our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a14f&quot; id=&quot;a14f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Identifying my universal needs had a powerful effect on me. Once you uncover the universal need, it’s much easier to identify new strategies that meet everyone’s universal needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;59c4&quot; id=&quot;59c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;4. Requests vs. Demands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;57d7&quot; id=&quot;57d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;What is the difference between a request and a demand? Both are strategies that would meet an unmet need. But unlike demands, requests are invitations for the other person to meet our needs . . . but only if it isn’t in conflict with one of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;87b3&quot; id=&quot;87b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are three principles that can help you make clear requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;be07&quot; id=&quot;be07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;a) Make it specific.&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I request that you be more respectful,’ is vague — what signals respect to you may not signal respect to someone else. Spell out the concrete behaviours that would meet your need for respect: ‘I request that you arrive at meetings on time.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a03&quot; id=&quot;5a03&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;b) Say what you want, not what you don’t want.&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I request that you don’t dismiss other people’s ideas straightaway,’ explains what you don’t want, but it doesn’t spell out what you &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want. Take time to clarify the behaviours you want to see. For example: ‘I request that when a team member shares an idea, you ask two or three probing questions before sharing your conclusion.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b59d&quot; id=&quot;b59d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;c) Stay curious.&lt;/strong&gt; There are many ways to satisfy your underlying needs, but is there a way of satisfying &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;everybody’s&lt;/em&gt; needs? To maximise the chance of having your needs met, treat ‘no’ as an invitation to explore the needs stopping someone from saying ‘yes’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d762&quot; id=&quot;d762&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Remember, great communication isn’t just about what you say, it’s about what other people hear. Even something as simple as, ‘I’d like you to be on time for the next meeting,’ can have an unintended meaning, depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d7ec&quot; id=&quot;d7ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Don’t be afraid to check in and ask someone to recap what they heard. You don’t want to patronise them, so be diplomatic and politely ask, ‘Just so we know we’re on the same page, could you play back what I’m asking of you?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;faaf&quot; id=&quot;faaf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The 40-Word Rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;60f5&quot; id=&quot;60f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;During difficult conversations, it’s important to be extremely concise. Aim to describe your observations, feelings, needs and requests in less than 40 words. Using more words suggests you’re justifying your needs, and this decreases their power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0484&quot; id=&quot;0484&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s also worth noting the importance of having these conversations face-to-face. NVC loses some of its power when it’s in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;045b&quot; id=&quot;045b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here are some examples of the kind of feedback needed in startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;de33&quot; id=&quot;de33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;To a co-founder:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘When you said, “I’m not happy with your work,” to me in front of the team, I felt embarrassed because it didn’t meet my need for trust and recognition. Please, could we set up a weekly one-on-one session to share feedback in private?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;a06a&quot; id=&quot;a06a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;To an investor:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I haven’t received any responses from the last three monthly updates. I’m feeling concerned because I need input. Please, would you mind getting back to me with responses to my questions in the last update?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;485c&quot; id=&quot;485c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;To a teammate:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘You arrived 10 minutes late to the last three team meetings. I am frustrated because, as a team, we have a need for efficiency. Please, could you help me understand what’s happening?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c705&quot; id=&quot;c705&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;All this preparation for 30–40 words may sound like a lot of work. It is a lot of work. But the result is clear, concise and powerful. No naming and shaming. No waffling. Just clarity about what you’ve observed, how you feel about it, and what needs are not being met. And at the end, you have a clear, actionable request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;43ab&quot; id=&quot;43ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How to React When your Request is Met with ‘No’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3ec4&quot; id=&quot;3ec4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;You’ve said your piece and made a request. In a perfect world, the other person would say, ‘Yes, of course.’ However, even the most careful feedback can be met with defensiveness and hostility. How should you respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3611&quot; id=&quot;3611&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Just as you figured out your feelings and needs &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the difficult conversation, hearing a ‘no’ is your chance to empathise with the other person. How is the other person feeling? And what unmet needs are stopping them from saying ‘yes’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;417b&quot; id=&quot;417b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is the hardest part of all: to see past their evaluations, thoughts and strategies, and stay focused on clarifying their underlying needs. In conflict, empathy is more effective than insisting or convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;a61d&quot; id=&quot;a61d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--pullquote-em&quot;&gt;‘Empathy is the gift of hearing someone without taking it personally,’—Marshall Rosenberg, author of Nonviolent Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0770&quot; id=&quot;0770&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;To empathise, ask questions that aim to clarify the other person’s feelings and needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;3f42&quot; id=&quot;3f42&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Are you feeling hurt because you need some understanding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d59d&quot; id=&quot;d59d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Are you feeling angry because you need your hard work to be recognised?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9f2a&quot; id=&quot;9f2a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Is there more you’d like to say?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;bfb1&quot; id=&quot;bfb1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;You don’t have to get it right — you just have to be curious. Silence is often more powerful than words, and when you uncover the needs that stop someone from saying ‘yes’, you’re much closer to finding a strategy that meets everyone’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5e2a&quot; id=&quot;5e2a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Similarly, if you’re on the receiving end of a request and have to say ‘no’, state the underlying need that stops you from saying ‘yes’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7f30&quot; id=&quot;7f30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Boundaries and Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9205&quot; id=&quot;9205&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The outcome of a difficult conversation isn’t necessarily an agreement. We hope that we can get our needs met, but sometimes this isn’t possible. The sad truth is that no one can meet our needs all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;32df&quot; id=&quot;32df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the responsibility of meeting our needs is our own. So we need to set boundaries and outline the consequences of crossing those boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6cff&quot; id=&quot;6cff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Outlining consequences is one of the most uncomfortable parts of being a manager, especially for people that want to be liked. What if the other person thinks we’re being unfair?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0819&quot; id=&quot;0819&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Keep in mind that appropriate consequences are those whose purpose is to protect your needs, not to punish the other person. In other words, consequences should be protective, not punitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ec6&quot; id=&quot;5ec6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s say an employee continually misses their sales quotas. As a manager, you are responsible for the effectiveness of your team — and every team &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; effectiveness. If deadlines continue to be missed (the boundary), you might have to switch their responsibilities or move them on (the consequence). It’s not personal, it’s just what you’ll do to protect your need for effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;59e1&quot; id=&quot;59e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Compassionate Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;19b5&quot; id=&quot;19b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The art of compassionate leadership is in being able to empathise with others while also empathising with yourself. This helps you to communicate more directly, and to better manage healthy conflict. It can even make you a better designer, marketer, and salesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d70f&quot; id=&quot;d70f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I still feel vulnerable when exposing my emotions. It still takes time to identify what I need. And it’s still easier to identify what I &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; want than what I &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want. But I’m persevering, and it’s having a massive impact on my relationships, by making difficult conversations just that little bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Morgan Freeman Converts His 124-Acre Ranch into a Giant Bee Sanctuary</title>
<link>https://life.gomcgill.com/morgan-freeman-converted-giant-ranch-bee-sanctuary-protection</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://life.gomcgill.com/morgan-freeman-converted-giant-ranch-bee-sanctuary-protection</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Morgan Freeman is a lot of things. Apart from being one of the most renowned actors on the planet, the 81-year-old celebrity has time and again raised his incredible voice to call attention to a number of concerning issues. The star added yet another title to his illustrious resume as an actor, filmmaker, and director, in 2014 when he took on the label of a beekeeper. He decided to do so in order to help put an end to the dwindling bee population on the planet and do what he can to revive and conserve their presence on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeman joined the array of concerned activists all around the world desperately trying to halt the alarming rate at which bees are drying off. While many of them contribute towards the cause by planting flowers for bees to visit and collect nectar from, or by starting petitions to end the use of pesticides which kill off the insects, Morgan joined the movement by converting his 124-acre ranch in Mississippi into a great sanctuary for them. In a July 2014 interview with Jimmy Fallon, the actor revealed that he'd taken up beekeeping as a hobby just about two weeks prior to his appearance on the show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthyfoodhouse.com/morgan-freeman-has-converted-his-124-acre-ranch-into-a-giant-sanctuary-to-help-save-the-bee-population/?fbclid=IwAR304UDrAfsmWF8K--UM0-_8lWh9EGElAFXfob2armQJM4_VXagKjpVdBUk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; explained that he'd taken up the hobby as a result of the mass bee die-offs over the past few years and that he had imported 26 hives full of bees from Arkansas to his ranch, where he now feeds them sugar water. Apparently, the bees have taken a great liking to Freeman as despite not wearing a protective suit while tending to them, he has never once been stung. He said, &quot;I have not ever used the beekeeping hat with my bees. They haven’t stung me yet, as right now I am not trying to harvest honey or anything, but I just feed them…I also think that they understand, ‘Hey, don’t bother this guy, he’s got sugar water here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-container&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;hidden-hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iSBxGrIF89s&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;hidden-hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;end-of-block-quote&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the bigger picture behind turning his gigantic ranch into a bee sanctuary, Freeman said, &quot;There is a concerted effort for bringing bees back onto the planet…We do not realize that they are the foundation, I think, of the growth of the planet, the vegetation…I have a lot of flowering things, and I have a gardener too. As she takes care of the bees too, all she does is figure out, ‘OK, what would they like to have?’, so we have got acres and acres of clover, and we have some planting stuff like lavender, I have got like, maybe 140 magnolia trees, big blossoms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jodi Monelle, the founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livekindly.co/the-importance-of-bees/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LIVEKINDLY&lt;/a&gt; shed light on the importance of the role bees play in our ecosystem and the means by which we could stop them from going extinct in a detailed post on the website. She wrote: &lt;em&gt;Bee populations have been decreasing steadily across the globe over recent years, and with a ginormous 44% loss between 2015 and 2016 in the U.S. alone, it seems that now is a more crucial time than ever to find effective methods to protect them. The National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) states that 'Researchers are calling the mass disappearance ‘Colony Collapse Disorder''&lt;/em&gt; and that &lt;em&gt;'The number of hives in the United States is now at its lowest point in the past 50 years'.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She listed three primary causes of the falling bee population. &lt;em&gt;Commonly used in crop cultivation and throughout the agriculture industry in general, chemical sprays and pesticides have been found to be partially responsible for the death and impairment of bees&lt;/em&gt;, she wrote, citing toxicity in bee colonies subsequent to chemical exposure as one of the reasons behind the insects dying. In addition to insecticides, intensive farming practices which are leaving homeless and viruses and parasites of the likes of Varroa destructor and Nosema ceranae have also been found to be serious threats to honeybee colonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monelle continued: &lt;em&gt;Like all species, the humble bumble bee plays a pivotal role in the health of our environment and the ecosystems within it. Bees, in particular, are largely responsible for regulating our food supply by way of pollinating of our crops. In fact, just 2% of bees have been found to be responsible for pollinating 80% of our crops (globally!). Bees may be small but they are extremely hard working creatures and if that tiny two percent is lost, 80% of our food from crop cultivation will also disappear. We’re talking apples, oranges, avocados, blueberries, broccoli, onions, almonds and so much more. Considering that the world is already suffering from a severe food scarcity – is this what we want to be heading towards? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I did a bee handling lab today! Did you know that honey bees have to see veterinarians too when they get sick ? Every year 35% of the bee population in the states dies. These guys pollinate many of our crops so it’s super important to take care of them! They were so cute! 🐝🐝 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LY2ufK15iq&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LY2ufK15iq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaborating on the different ways in which one could help save bees, Monelle claims plating bee gardens or choosing organic plants and fruits or even growing your own, could do the trick. Although it isn't an easy task to measure the exact impact of Freeman's contribution to the cause has on bee population, his story definitely serves as motivation to all of us that no matter how small, we could all do something to help save bees and subsequently towards the well being of our planet. After all, none of us want to leave our beautiful homes and migrate to some other desolate planet, do we?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email from Google saying they removed Mommy Saver Plus (the paid version of Mommy Saver) for &quot;deceptive ads&quot;.  This is strange because Mommy Saver Plus has no ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lW00jr7Wxbs/XJlMHhavHEI/AAAAAAAAbyY/PrkdlCPTfRsIp-g5BPyaJGEjas3B294KACLcBGAs/s1600/email_from_google.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;667&quot; data-original-width=&quot;967&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lW00jr7Wxbs/XJlMHhavHEI/AAAAAAAAbyY/PrkdlCPTfRsIp-g5BPyaJGEjas3B294KACLcBGAs/s320/email_from_google.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking closer, it seems like they mistook another app for mine (edit 2019-03-26: I looked up that app and it has been removed as well).  Mommy Saver Plus is mostly black and white with touches of color.  This app is very colorful (app names and email address covered so I don't cause problems for another developer):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--kd-sha93Ks/XJlMKSBCKYI/AAAAAAAAbyc/5xi6yBqzvy4DNeLVRLZ0tIJ7KThUeBbXQCLcBGAs/s1600/anonymized.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;875&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--kd-sha93Ks/XJlMKSBCKYI/AAAAAAAAbyc/5xi6yBqzvy4DNeLVRLZ0tIJ7KThUeBbXQCLcBGAs/s320/anonymized.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mommy Saver Plus looks more like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-deBaUi7ZOBc/XJlaQpxXf0I/AAAAAAAAbys/ef7xuOOCj2wJeOOeIAJt6QPaljEEftlPgCLcBGAs/s1600/screenshots_smaller.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;883&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-deBaUi7ZOBc/XJlaQpxXf0I/AAAAAAAAbys/ef7xuOOCj2wJeOOeIAJt6QPaljEEftlPgCLcBGAs/s320/screenshots_smaller.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will just get fixed and go away in the next couple days and I'll have a good laugh about it later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
To Google's credit, the email says I can &quot;remove any ads that violate the Deceptive Ads policy&quot; and re-submit the app.  They apparently also have an appeals process (I've already submitted the appeal 2019-03-25).&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with Google's ad policies, but it's a little strange that they would remove this app anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm also a little worried because I've read on HN horror stories about Google doing things like this or worse.  I'm nervous about re-submitting until I see the result of the appeal.  Mommy Saver Plus doesn't make much money, but I want to publish a new app in a few months and don't want to have problems with that.  And I definitely don't want problems with my Google account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows anything useful, I'd appreciate it.  Googling for &quot;play store removed mistake&quot; doesn't yield much useful results.
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter forces all new users to enter a valid phone number</title>
<link>https://sucky.ninja/blog/twitter-locks-all-new-user-account-in-order-to-force-them-to-give-up-their-phone-numbers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sucky.ninja/blog/twitter-locks-all-new-user-account-in-order-to-force-them-to-give-up-their-phone-numbers</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;The discovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to create a twitter account many months ago and did it just fine. I wanted to follow people I find interesting and perhaps also send my creations out to the ether for everyone to see. So I made an account and followed some people like Elon Musk, NASA etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just a few minutes, the page displayed in the ingress of this blog post were displayed. I was blocked because of &quot;unusual behavior&quot;. They required not only a pass of Google Captcha, but also &lt;strong&gt;required my phone number.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sucky.ninja/uploads/cf77fff7-2231-41f9-b650-f176fc50875a-twitter_not_a_robot.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;I am not a robot&quot; data-mce-src=&quot;/uploads/cf77fff7-2231-41f9-b650-f176fc50875a-twitter_not_a_robot.PNG&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sucky.ninja/uploads/29cd5c3f-f85b-4e55-8e3c-4c826c3c9edd-twitter_phone_number.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-mce-src=&quot;/uploads/29cd5c3f-f85b-4e55-8e3c-4c826c3c9edd-twitter_phone_number.PNG&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't understand why they would need my phone number to assess that I am indeed a human being. So I kindly declined the offer, logged out and never logged in to that account again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was nagging in my head while listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZCBRHOg3PQ&quot; target=&quot;&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZCBRHOg3PQ&quot;&gt;the Joe Rogan podcasts with the Twitter CEO and Tim Pool&lt;/a&gt;. I am not a fan of their actions recently and I cannot even get onto their platform to begin tweeting since I don't want to give them my phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when it hit me, I had just recently moved to a new location and had a new ISP. I had a completely different IP address and just to be sure I installed Ubuntu 18.10 onto my computer and very well, yes my account got pretty much instantly locked just as the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had a new IP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had a newly installed operating system and browser.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way my registration process is anything unusual. I didn't tweet a single tweet. I just waited a couple of minutes and then reloaded the page. &lt;strong&gt;Locked&lt;/strong&gt;. No addons, no nothing. &lt;strong&gt;What exactly about my behavior is unusual?&lt;/strong&gt; That I registered on your platform?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then tried to logon to my old account that got locked month prior to this event only to be stuck in a random &quot;consent&quot; loop. Each time I reload the page I get the same consent error page and I cannot even log out from this experience. it has been like this for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sucky.ninja/uploads/dfd6e18e-5391-4567-abee-4a7c7c95b755-twitter_consent_loop.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-mce-src=&quot;/uploads/dfd6e18e-5391-4567-abee-4a7c7c95b755-twitter_consent_loop.PNG&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the actual fuck twitter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop blocking new users and stop relying on this dark pattern, I do not want to give you my phone number.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>UK Releases 130 Terabytes of Oil and Gas Data</title>
<link>https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=5282</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=5282</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The UK Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) is making available to the public some 130 terabytes of well, geophysical, field, and infrastructure data through the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ndr.ogauthority.co.uk/dp/controller/PLEASE_LOGIN_PAGE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UK Oil and Gas National Data Repository&lt;/a&gt; (NDR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset covers 12,500 offshore wellbores, 5,000 seismic surveys, and 3,000 pipelines over more than five decades. The release is intended to help promote new investment, technology, and exploration activity on the UK Continental Shelf, ultimately boosting recovery, the OGA said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NDR creates research opportunities for both technology and analysis,” explained Simon James, OGA chief information officer. “For the industry, it means access to a huge data pool to harness digital technology, relieves them of the regulatory requirement to retain information, and enhances collaboration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registered users can search, view, and download data for free or order data for delivery on media on a cost-reflective basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OGA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://data-ogauthority.opendata.arcgis.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already-established open data site&lt;/a&gt; includes data on licensing rounds, exploration, drilling, and production, including a production dashboard for the Buchan Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiling of the NDR follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=4329&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another big North Sea data release&lt;/a&gt; by Equinor last year. The Norwegian operator made available 40,000 files of subsurface and production data from the Volve Field.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EFI Boot Application in C#</title>
<link>https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/zerosharp/blob/master/efi-no-runtime/README.md</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/zerosharp/blob/master/efi-no-runtime/README.md</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;This sample is a EFI boot application written in C# that displays Hello World. It runs without an OS, on x64 bare metal hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4955f1df163b7936ea975736ac6d4cb286faa39d/68747470733a2f2f6d696765656c2e736b2f65666973686172702e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4955f1df163b7936ea975736ac6d4cb286faa39d/68747470733a2f2f6d696765656c2e736b2f65666973686172702e706e67&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://migeel.sk/efisharp.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building the program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to the general instructions at the root of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Booting the generated program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;build.cmd&lt;/code&gt; should produce a BOOTX64.EFI file in the current directory. There are multiple ways to run this. QEMU with an EFI firmware should work. I use Hyper-V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;build.cmd vhd&lt;/code&gt; will produce a VHDX file for you that you can run on Hyper-V directly (it prompts for elevation, so don't be surprised). You need to create a new Gen 2 virtual machine in Hyper-V and attach the generated disk. Make sure to turn off Secure boot in the virtual machine: the EFI image is not signed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Name It, and They Will Come</title>
<link>https://overreacted.io/name-it-and-they-will-come/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://overreacted.io/name-it-and-they-will-come/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve discovered something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You haven’t seen solutions &lt;em&gt;quite like this&lt;/em&gt; before. You try to keep your ego in check and be skeptical. But the butterflies in your stomach won’t listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to get carried away, but deep down you already know it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re onto something.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea turns into a project. The first commit is just 500 lines. But in a few days, you build it up just enough to start using it in real code. A few like-minded people join you in improving it. You learn something new about it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re still skeptical but you can’t pretend to ignore it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This idea has wings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You encounter many obstacles. They require you to make changes. Peculiarly, these changes only make the original idea stronger. Usually, you feel like you’re &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; something. But this time, it feels like you are &lt;em&gt;discovering&lt;/em&gt; something as if it already existed. You’ve chosen a principle and followed it to the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, you’re convinced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This idea deserves to be heard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work at a bureaucratic company, maybe you fight the legal department to open source it. If you are a freelancer, maybe you keep polishing it late at night after the client work is done. Perhaps you wish you were paid for it. But nobody knows about your project just yet. You’re hoping that they will. Someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pull yourself together to get it ready for the first release. You write more tests, set up the CI, create extensive documentation. You design a beautiful landing page. You’re ready to share your idea with the whole wide world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s the launch day. You publish the project on GitHub. You tweet about it and submit the landing page to the popular open source news aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push origin master
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; publish&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re anxious to hear the world’s take on your idea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they’ll love it. Maybe they’ll hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you know is it deserves to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your project hit the front page of a popular news aggregator. Somebody visible in the community tweeted about it too. What are they saying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your heart sinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that people &lt;em&gt;didn’t like&lt;/em&gt; the project. You know it has tradeoffs and expected people to talk about them. But that’s not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, the comments are largely &lt;em&gt;irrelevant&lt;/em&gt; to your idea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top comment thread picks on the coding style in a README example. It turns into an argument about indentation with over a hundred replies and a brief history of how different programming languages approached formatting. There are obligatory mentions of gofmt and Python. Have you tried Prettier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody mentions that open source projects shouldn’t have beautiful landing pages because it’s misleading marketing. What if a junior developer falls for it without fully understanding the fundamentals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a response, somebody argues the landing page design is boring. Additionally, it’s broken in Firefox. Clearly, this means the project author doesn’t care about the open web. Is the web as we know it dying? It’s time for some game theory…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next comment is a generic observation about the nature of abstractions, and how they can lead to too much “boilerplate” (or, alternatively, “magic”). The top reply explains that one shouldn’t confuse “simple” with “easy”. Actually, Rich Hickey gave a very good talk about this. Have you watched it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, why do we need libraries at all? Some languages do well with a built-in standard library. Is npm a mistake? The leftpad accident could happen again. Should we build npm right into the browser? What about the standards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confused, you close the tab.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be that your idea is simply not as interesting as you thought. That happens. It might also be that you poorly explained it for a casual visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there might be another reason why you didn’t get relevant feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to discuss things that are easy to talk about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal shared experiences are easy to talk about. That includes topics like code formatting, verbosity vs magic, configuration vs convention, differences in the community cultures, scandals, tech interviews, industry gossip, macro trends and design opinions. We have a shared vocabulary for all of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also constantly pattern-matching. If some pattern triggers an emotional response (whether relevant or irrelevant to the presented idea), we’ll likely base the first impression on it. Learning by association is a tremendously valuable mental shortcut. However, familiar style may obscure the novel substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your idea really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; new, there might be no shared vocabulary to discuss it yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem it’s solving might be so ingrained that we don’t even notice it. It’s the elephant in the room. &lt;strong&gt;And we can’t discuss what we never named.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you give a name to a problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same way humans always did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By telling a story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name it, and they will come.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Adult Brain Does Grow New Neurons After All, Study Says</title>
<link>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-adult-brain-does-grow-new-neurons-after-all-study-says/</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the memory center of the human brain can grow new cells, it might help people recover from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), delay the onset of Alzheimer’s, deepen our understanding of epilepsy and offer new insights into memory and learning. If not, well then, it’s just one other way people are different from rodents and birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have debated whether the birth of new neurons—called neurogenesis—was possible in an area of the brain that is responsible for learning, memory and mood regulation. A growing body of research suggested they could, but then a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25975&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; paper last year raised doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study published today in another of the Nature family of journals—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0375-9&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—tips the balance back toward “yes.” In light of the new study, “I would say that there is an overwhelming case for the neurogenesis throughout life in humans,” Jonas Frisén, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said in an e-mail. Frisén, who was not involved in the new research, wrote a News and Views about the study in the current issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone was convinced. Arturo Alvarez-Buylla was the senior author on last year’s &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper, which questioned the existence of neurogenesis. Alvarez-Buylla, a professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, says he still doubts that new neurons develop in the brain’s hippocampus after toddlerhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think this at all settles things out,” he says. “I’ve been studying adult neurogenesis all my life. I wish I could find a place [in humans] where it does happen convincingly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-the-adult-brain-really-grow-new-neurons/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some researchers&lt;/a&gt; have thought that the brain circuits of primates—including humans—would be too disrupted by the growth of substantial numbers of new neurons. Alvarez-Buylla says he thinks the scientific debate over the existence of neurogenesis should continue. “Basic knowledge is fundamental. Just knowing whether adult neurons get replaced is a fascinating basic problem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New technologies that can locate cells in the living brain and measure the cells’ individual activity, none of which were used in the &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; study, may eventually put to rest any lingering questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of researchers praised the new study as thoughtful and carefully conducted. It’s a “technical tour de force,” and addresses the concerns raised by last year’s paper, says Michael Bonaguidi, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from Spain, tested a variety of methods of preserving brain tissue from 58 newly deceased people. They found that different methods of preservation led to different conclusions about whether new neurons could develop in the adult and aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain tissue has to be preserved within a few hours after death, and specific chemicals used to preserve the tissue, or the proteins that identify newly developing cells will be destroyed, said Maria Llorens-Martin, the paper’s senior author. Other researchers have missed the presence of these cells, because their brain tissue was not as precisely preserved, says Llorens-Martin, a neuroscientist at the Autonomous University of Madrid in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Hsieh, a professor at the University of Texas San Antonio who was not involved in the new research, said the study provides a lesson for all scientists who rely on the generosity of brain donations. “If and when we go and look at something in human postmortem, we have to be very cautious about these technical issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llorens-Martin said she began carefully collecting and preserving brain samples in 2010, when she realized that many brains stored in brain banks were not adequately preserved for this kind of research. In their study, she and her colleagues examined the brains of people who died with their memories intact, and those who died at different stages of Alzheimer’s disease. She found that the brains of people with Alzheimer’s showed few if any signs of new neurons in the hippocampus—with less signal the further along the people were in the course of the disease. This suggests that the loss of new neurons—if it could be detected in the living brain—would be an early indicator of the onset of Alzheimer’s, and that promoting new neuronal growth could delay or prevent the disease that now affects more than 5.5 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rusty Gage, president of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and a neuroscientist and professor there, says he was impressed by the researchers’ attention to detail. “Methodologically, it sets the bar for future studies,” says Gage, who was not involved in the new research but was the senior author in 1998 of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1198_1313&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that found the first evidence for neurogenesis. Gage says this new study addresses the concerns raised by Alvarez-Buylla’s research. “From my view, this puts to rest that one blip that occurred,” he says. “This paper in a very nice way… systematically evaluates all the issues that we all feel are very important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurogenesis in the hippocampus matters, Gage says, because evidence in animals shows that it is essential for pattern separation, “allowing an animal to distinguish between two events that are closely associated with each other.” In people, Gage says, the inability to distinguish between two similar events could explain why patients with PTSD keep reliving the same experiences, even though their circumstances have changed. Also, many deficits seen in the early stages of cognitive decline are similar to those seen in animals whose neurogenesis has been halted, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthy animals, neurogenesis promotes resilience in stressful situations, Gage says. Mood disorders, including depression, have also been linked to neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hsieh says her research on epilepsy has found that newborn neurons get miswired, disrupting brain circuits and causing seizures and potential memory loss. In rodents with epilepsy, if researchers prevent the abnormal growth of new neurons, they prevent seizures, Hsieh says, giving her hope that something similar could someday help human patients. Epilepsy increases someone’s risk of Alzheimer’s as well as depression and anxiety, she says. “So, it’s all connected somehow. We believe that the new neurons play a vital role connecting all of these pieces,” Hsieh says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice and rats, researchers can stimulate the growth of new neurons by getting the rodents to exercise more or by providing them with environments that are more cognitively or socially stimulating, Llorens-Martin says. “This could not be applied to advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease. But if we could act at earlier stages where mobility is not yet compromised,” she says, “who knows, maybe we could slow down or prevent some of the loss of plasticity [in the brain].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
