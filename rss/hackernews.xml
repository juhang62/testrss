&lt;p&gt;Intel recently resigned itself to engaging in a price war with AMD's EPYC processors as it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-xeon-refresh-new-cascade-lake-refresh-cpus-up-to-60-percent-cheaper-per-core&quot;&gt;slashed gen-on-gen pricing for its Cascade Lake Refresh processors&lt;/a&gt;. Now AMD is taking the battle in an entirely different direction as it unveils three new workload-optimized processors that strike at the heart of the mid-range market, but with higher pricing than the preceding models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD says the new 7Fx2 frequency-optimized processors offer the world's fastest per-core performance from x86 server CPUs as the company looks to upset Intel's traditional leadership position in per-core performance. The boosted performance comes as a byproduct of an increased base frequency of 500 MHz paired with a healthy dollop of extra L3 cache that benefits workloads that benefit from keeping data close to the execution cores, like relational databases, high performance computing (HPC), and hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;hawk-widget&quot; data-render-type=&quot;fte&quot; data-widget-type=&quot;seasonal&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff comes in the form of a higher TDP rating, meaning the processors consume more power and generate more heat, along with the higher pricing that comes as a result of the premium-binned silicon. However, the three new EPYC Rome 7Fx2 processors offset those metrics with much higher performance, thus enabling denser solutions. AMD says that combination leads to reduced up-front costs and a 50% reduction in total operating costs (TCO) for the target markets, thus justifying the higher price points.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD continues to nibble away at Intel's data center market share and says that it is on track to reach mid-double-digit share by the second quarter of this year. The new 7Fx2-series processors look to broaden that attack into applications where Intel has traditionally held the advantage. Let's take a closer look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new processors come in 8-, 16-, and 24-core flavors that wield notable increases in both base and boost frequencies. They still come with the same 7nm process and Zen 2 microarchitecture found on other EPYC Rome processors, but AMD says its targeted refinements equate to a sizeable performance advantage over preceding models. AMD provided estimated SPEC2017_int_base benchmarks that show a sizeable increase in both performance-per-core and performance-per-dollar in the lightly-threaded workloads that have long been one of Intel Xeon's strongest selling points, particularly for software that is licensed on a per-core basis. These types of applications command high premiums that increase based upon the number of active cores, so per-core performance is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all vendor-supplied benchmarks, not to mention estimations, take these with a grain of salt. However, we do have processors in for testing, and these benchmarks coincide with our basic expectations for the improved specifications. AMD also has the advantage of more memory channels (eight vs. Intel's six) and faster supported memory speeds (DDR4-3200 vs. Intel's DDR4-2933). Couple that with a higher 4TB memory capacity (Intel tops out at 2TB without additional fees) and 128 lanes of PCIe 4.0 (Intel has 48 lanes of PCIe 3.0), and AMD has a compelling performance story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.75&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;150&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$2,925&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3.2 / 3.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;128&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;155&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$575&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;EPYC Rome 7252&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3.1 / 3.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$475&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the top of the stack remains unchanged. But while those models tend to grab the flashbulbs, the real volume resides in the mid-range dual-socket server market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD's new models slot in below the new VMware licensing model that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomshardware.com/news/vmware-caps-per-cpu-fees-at-32-cores-amds-epyc-rome-impacted&quot;&gt;doubles pricing for processors with more than 32 cores&lt;/a&gt;. The increased per-core performance also benefits systems where per-core licensing costs often outweigh the price of the hardware. Utilizing the software more fully will ultimately reduce cost, and AMD tackles that mission with a 500 MHz increase to the base frequencies. That comes with a 60W increase in TDP for the 24-core 48-thread EPYC 7F72, a 90W increase for the 16-core 32-thread EPYC 7F52, and a 25W increase for the EPYC 7F32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD also increased the boost frequency to 3.7 GHz for its 24-core model, and 3.9 GHz for its 16- and 8-core variants. These boost frequencies adhere to AMD's standard practice of guaranteeing the rating for one physical core only, which is then complemented by thread-targeting that ensures the fastest core receives the brunt of single-threaded workloads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased L3 cache capacities also pop off the page, with the 24-core model sporting 192MB of L3, a 64MB increase, and the 16-core model weighs in with a whopping 256MB of cache, an incredible increase of 128MB. This beefy cache is incredibly potent in the target applications and contributes to the increased per-core performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chips come with a higher price point to match the specifications. The 24-core model weighs in at $2,450, an extra $667 over AMD's comparable model but still less expensive than Intel's $2,700 Gold 6248R. The 16-core model retails for $3,100, a $2,122 markup over the 7302. This model lands only slightly below Intel's $3,286 Gold 6246R, underlining AMD's confidence that it has the faster chip. That comes despite the 6246R's higher boost frequency, but that's the advantage of AMD's 256MB of L3 cache compared to Intel's 35.75MB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD cited performance benchmarks in a few applications that typically come with per-core licensing models. That includes a surprising claim of 31% more performance from a single 7F72 model than two of Intel's Xeon Gold 6246 chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved performance is great, but it won't enjoy broad uptake if there isn't a robust set of qualified solutions available from reputable vendors. As such, AMD has been busy building out its ecosystem of platforms. The company now has 110 platforms in the market and plans to expand to 140+ by the end of 2020 from the likes of Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD also continues to broaden the spate of instances available through cloud service providers, with 106 available now in all flavors, from compute to balanced types, and plans for 150+ by the end of the year. These instances come from industry leaders like AWS, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle, Tencent, and Baidu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD also announced today that it has been certified on Nutanix platforms from HPE, and Supermicro has launched its first blade-based EPYC Rome system with its SuperBlade system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD's move marks a starkly different tack than Intel has taken lately as the latter has reduced pricing across the board to assuage customers that now have a less expensive x86 alternative. Despite Intel's price adjustments, AMD still holds the value crown and its expansion into the frequency-optimized category gives it yet another angle of attack on the lucrative server market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're working on a full review of the new models as we pit them against Intel's Cascade Lake Refresh models. Stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>SoftBank expects $24B in losses from Vision Fund, WeWork and OneWeb</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/softbank-expects-24-billion-in-losses-from-vision-fund-wework-and-oneweb-investments/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/softbank-expects-24-billion-in-losses-from-vision-fund-wework-and-oneweb-investments/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;The Japanese technology conglomerate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/&quot;&gt;SoftBank Group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://group.softbank/system/files/news/en/press/2020/20200413/pdf/20200413_en.pdf&quot;&gt;said it would lose a staggering $24 billion on investments&lt;/a&gt; made through its Vision Fund and bets on the co-working real estate company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wework.com/&quot;&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt; and satellite telecommunications company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oneweb.world/&quot;&gt;OneWeb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the company expects the losses to help generate a $7 billion total loss for the technology giant for the year as its ambitious bets on early-stage companies come up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years SoftBank and its founder &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/masayoshi-son&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;masayoshi-son&quot;&gt;Masayoshi Son&lt;/a&gt; have staked billions of (other people’s) dollars and its own fortunes on a vision that investments in machine learning technologies, robotics and next-generation telecommunications would reap hundreds of billions in financial rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that was the vision that Son and his team sold, the reality was multiple billions of dollars invested into real estate investment plays like &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/wework-857c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;wework-857c&quot;&gt;WeWork,&lt;/a&gt; OpenDoor and Compass, and companies with direct-to-consumer merchandising plays like Brandless, pet supply businesses like Wag and the food delivery business DoorDash. Add the hotel chain Oyo to the mix and the investment selection from the Vision Fund looks even less visionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, several of its investments ran aground. Though none of them imploded as spectacularly as WeWork — whose valuation was slashed from more than $40 billion to around $8 billion — many have struggled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandless &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/10/softbank-backed-brandless-shuts-its-doors-for-good/&quot;&gt;went bust earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and real estate &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/with-the-real-estate-industry-facing-headwinds-softbank-backed-compass-lays-off-15-of-staff-after/&quot;&gt;investments in Compass&lt;/a&gt; along with investments in travel and tourism-related businesses like Oyo have suffered in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has shuttered economies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many SoftBank and &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank-vision-fund&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;softbank-vision-fund&quot;&gt;SoftBank Vision Fund&lt;/a&gt; bets were made into companies that have failed, seem to be on that path or perhaps may struggle in the economic downturn, not every wager is a clunker. The Vision Fund put lots of capital into Slack before it went public, and the company has caught a huge tailwind in the remote-work boom that we’re currently seeing in light of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most visionary of the SoftBank investments (and one not included in the Vision Fund), &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneweb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;oneweb&quot;&gt;OneWeb,&lt;/a&gt; too, collapsed under the weight of its own capital-intensive vision for a network of satellites providing high-speed global telecommunications services. Zume, SoftBank’s robotic pizza delivery business, also folded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason all of these gambles haven’t completely destroyed SoftBank is that the company still has a cash cow in its Alibaba stake and a relatively strong core business in telecommunications and semiconductor holdings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The difference in income before income tax is, in addition to the above, mainly due to the expected recording of non-operating loss totaling approximately JPY 800 billion for fiscal 2019 on investments held outside of SoftBank Vision Fund, including The We Company (WeWork) and WorldVu Satellites Limited (OneWeb),” the company said in a statement. “This will be partially offset by the gain relating to the settlement of variable prepaid forward contract using Alibaba shares recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the dilution gain from changes in equity interest in Alibaba recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, as well as an expected year-on-year increase in income on equity method investments related to Alibaba.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it seems that Son was too enamored of the mythology he’d created around himself as a maverick and a visionary. To the detriment of his company’s outside shareholders and investors.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AMZN.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O&quot;&gt;AMZN.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) said on Tuesday it had fired three reported critics of the company’s pandemic response for workplace violations, dismissals that drew sharp words from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and a labor coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company on Friday fired two user experience designers, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, for what it called repeated violations of internal policies, without specifying which ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two workers, who gained prominence for pushing the company to do more on climate change, had recently made public statements questioning Amazon’s pandemic safety measures and pledging to match donations of up to $500 to support staff at risk of getting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-commerce giant also said it dismissed Bashir Mohamed, a warehouse worker in Minnesota, “for inappropriate language, behavior, and violating social distancing guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their dismissals follow Amazon’s firing on March 30 of warehouse protest leader Christian Smalls on the grounds that he put others at risk by violating his paid quarantine when he joined a demonstration at Amazon’s Staten Island, New York, fulfillment center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statements shared with Reuters, Cunningham said she believed Amazon could play a powerful role during the crisis, but to do so, “we have to really listen to the workers who are on the front line, who don’t feel adequately protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costa said in her statement, “No company should punish their employees for showing concern for one another, especially during a pandemic!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s largest online retailer is facing intensifying scrutiny by lawmakers and unions over whether it is doing enough to protect staff from the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 1.9 million people, including workers at more than 50 of Amazon’s U.S. warehouses, according to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been racing to update safety protocols, distribute protective gear and keep warehouses functional as it works to ship essential goods to shoppers under widespread government stay-at-home orders. Small groups of employees have staged high-profile protests at several Amazon warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohamed, the associate fired in Minnesota, had organized for better working conditions and started pushing for more site cleaning and protective measures, according to BuzzFeed News, which first reported the dismissal and said the termination happened last week. The Washington Post earlier reported the firings of Costa and Cunningham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohamed could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Amazon said, “We respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so; however, these rights do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, well-being or safety of their colleagues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Smalls was fired in March, New York City opened an investigation and five Democratic U.S. Senators wrote to Amazon’s chief executive Jeff Bezos asking him to explain what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public pressure continued on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders tweeted: “Instead of firing employees who want justice, maybe Jeff Bezos — the richest man in the world — can focus on providing his workers with paid sick leave, a safe workplace, and a livable planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athena, a labor and activist coalition, called the latest dismissals “outrageous.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Airbreak.dev: Jailbreak your CPAP machine to turn them into ventilators</title>
<link>https://airbreak.dev</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://airbreak.dev</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CPAP running custom firmware&quot; src=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/images/ventilator-animated.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the COVID-19 crisis and resultant shortage of medical equipment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/mount-sinai-turns-hundreds-of-machines-for-sleep-apnea-into-hospital-ventilators-shares-instructions-worldwide/&quot;&gt;hospitals have developed protocols for using BiPAP (BIlevel Positive Airway Pressure) machines as non-invasive ventilators&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/media/136702/download&quot;&gt;FDA has approved the use of these modified BiPAP devices as ventilators&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PubInv/covid19-vent-list&quot;&gt;several groups&lt;/a&gt; are currently working on ventilator designs that involve a converted BiPAP. However, CPAP (Constant Positive Airway Pressure) devices are cheaper, more widely available, and similar both electrically and mechanically. Unfortunately, they are lacking in some features that the physicians require and, according to their manufacturer, CPAP machines &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.resmed.com/en-us/covid-19/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;would require significant rework in order to function as a ventilator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have done is to &quot;&lt;em&gt;jailbreak&lt;/em&gt;&quot; the the Airsense 10 CPAP machine, a common, low-cost sleep therapy device intended to treat sleep apnea, so that it is possible to run additional tasks on the device. These new tasks add the features and adjust the range of parameters that make it possible to use the device as a temporary ventilator. This can help ease the shortage until more real ventilators are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our changes bring the Airsense S10 to near feature parity with BiPAP machines from the same manufacturer, boost the maximum pressure output available, and provide a starting point to add more advanced emergency ventilator functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are consulting with doctors to validate that the modified firmware works as intended, the codebase in its current form should be considered a &lt;strong&gt;proof of concept&lt;/strong&gt; and is &lt;strong&gt;not intended for use in a life-support capacity&lt;/strong&gt;. Additional equipment like viral filters is also required. Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/#faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No IP belonging to device manufacturers is hosted in this repository, nor will it be accepted as a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-features&quot;&gt;Major features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adds a Pressure Control Ventilator (PCV) mode that oscillates between high and low pressure at a configurable breathing rate (stock firmware supports only a single pressure, with no breath rate control).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows maximum pressure to be increased to 30 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, as required by clinical protocols (stock firmware is limited to 20cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows smooth rapid pressure change rates for respiration rates up to 30 breaths per minute (stock firmware changes pressure at less than 1 cm/sec).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlocks all of the vendor modes and tunable configuration parameters, including ST and iVAPS modes present in the firmware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides access to all of the sensors (flow, pressure, temperature, tidal volume, minute ventilation, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Displays real-time graphs on the screen to show an immediate history of sensor data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-difference-between-cpap-and-bipap-machines&quot;&gt;What's the difference between CPAP and BiPAP machines?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Therapy mode menu on an unlocked Airsense 10 CPAP machine&quot; src=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/images/airsense-modes.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Airsense 10 that we have modified is a low cost sleep therapy device that provides a &lt;em&gt;Constant&lt;/em&gt; Positive Air Pressure to help with sleep apnea and other disorders. This CPAP mode applies constant pressure to the lungs, but it does not ventilate, or let air move in and out of the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BiPAP machines are more capable devices to treat sleep apnea and COPD that provide &lt;em&gt;Bi-level&lt;/em&gt; Positive Airway Pressure. Bi-level pressure &lt;em&gt;triggers&lt;/em&gt; on patient breaths, applying higher pressure when the patient tries to breathe in, and a lower pressure when the patient tries to exhale. This is what's called a &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; mode, which provides additional pressure support to a patient's natural breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences apply to the devices as they function &lt;strong&gt;out of the box&lt;/strong&gt;. Our work indicates that the actual difference between a low-end CPAP device and a high-end iVAPS device is just a &lt;strong&gt;software upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;. The CPAP machines have many of the same sensors as the more expensive models, and the Airsense 10 CPAP devices include in their firmware all of the other modes, such as iVAPS and BiPAP-ST. When we unlock that mode in software, the CPAP device functions like a much more capable and expensive iVAPS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea, that the difference between CPAP and BiPAP machines is a &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt; change rather than a &lt;em&gt;hardware&lt;/em&gt; change, is at the root of our work. If the common, highly distributed CPAP devices could have a software upgrade that turns them into iVAPS or BiPAP-ST devices capable of ventilating COVID patients, that would be a huge boon to the hospitals and health care workers around the world who are struggling with a lack of ventilators or alternatives to treat the influx of COVID patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a homebrew function to the existing firmware that alternates between pressures with a configurable delay allows the CPAP to effectively function as a Pressure Control Ventilator (PCV) for sedated patients. Enabling the vendor-provided iVAPS mode, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/info/extensions&quot;&gt;further customization and new extensions&lt;/a&gt;, should make the devices even more flexible and suitable for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;can-jailbroken-cpap-devices-be-used-to-treat-covid-patients&quot;&gt;Can jailbroken CPAP devices be used to treat COVID patients?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to be very clear here: this modified firmware should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be flashed on CPAP machines and used to treat COVID patients immediately. The firmware that we've developed is an effective demonstration of the capability, and while it has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/evaluation&quot;&gt;reviewed and validated by expert researchers, biomedical engineers, and clinical pulmonologists&lt;/a&gt;, it has not yet been put through FDA approval. Additionally, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.mountsinai.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2020/04/NIV-to-Ventilator-Modification-Protocol-v1.02-for-posting.pdf&quot;&gt;Mt Sinai's protocols for off-label non-invasive ventilation&lt;/a&gt; require additional modifications such as viral filter and remote control before the machines would be ready for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;could-hacked-machines-alleviate-the-shortage-of-ventilators&quot;&gt;Could hacked machines alleviate the shortage of ventilators?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the manufacturers developed their own firmware updates, or the FDA approves our jailbroken firmware, this could have an extremely large role in bridging the ventilator shortage gap. There are millions of unused or underutilized CPAP and BiPAP devices sitting in closets in America, and roughly another 500,000 units in warehouses in the country. These devices can be used as an alternate ventilator, for low-resource hospitals who are still waiting for the hospital ventilators to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;could-homebrew-firmware-go-through-fda-approval&quot;&gt;Could homebrew firmware go through FDA approval?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Airsense 10 CPAP machine with iVAPS configuration menu&quot; src=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/images/airsense-ivaps.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were no other option, our firmware could go through FDA approval, but we believe that the best route for rolling out these upgrades is to work with the manufacturers to use their resources to validate and distribute these upgrades safely and at scale. There are three main factors at play here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;14.762210796915&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is a regulatory/safety one: Under the recently-released FDA guidance on hardware and software modification of CPAP and BiPAP devices to treat COVID patients, the manufacturer has carte blanche to release an updated version of their firmware for their own devices without requiring explicit FDA approval -- they are in the best position from a technical, expertise, safety and regulatory perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is a practical one: There are many different models of CPAP and BiPAP devices, and reverse-engineering is a slow and painful process. We modified the firmware on the most common model of CPAP in America in about a week, but to get lots of ventilators quickly, you'd need a firmware modification for every mode of CPAP. What we've found in our work is that the work needed for the manufacturer to implement these upgrades is pretty minimal -- the manufacturer has access to the source code, to the schematics, and to the engineers who are intimately familiar with physiology and safety standards. We've found that, in many cases, the bulk of the work has already gone through FDA approval, like the iVAPS menu that is in the firmware on the ResMed Airsense device shown above. Even if other manufacturers had not written a line of code for their CPAP models, the pressure-control ventilator mode that we were able to implement is very simple to develop, designed to work on every CPAP device in existence, and would be a very low technology and regulatory barrier for manufacturers with the right people and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8.5811320754717&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is related to making these jailbreaks at scale: We could take in every unused CPAP device in the country, &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/disassembly&quot;&gt;unscrew the case&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/firmware&quot;&gt;re-flash the firmware&lt;/a&gt;. It's slow and expensive but could be solved with lots and lots of people. The thing is, of the 8 million CPAPs in the country, almost all 5 million shipped over the last 3 years have an always-on cellular IoT connection, reporting back usage information to doctors and insurance companies. That cellular connection also has over-the-air upgrade capability that can only be accessed from within the IT infrastructure of the device manufacturers. This is a big deal -- it means that they can selectively upgrade, by serial number, specific units to function as ventilators, without having to open them up -- it can all work over the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-whats-the-point&quot;&gt;So what's the point?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Onscreen graphs&quot; src=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/images/sprintf.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What our firmware does is show that it is possible to re-program these devices in a way that doctors can use to effectively ventilate COVID patients. We have been able to confirm the functionality of the devices in instrumented patient circuits operated by experts in pulmonological measurement. And there are doctors who agree that, if they had an FDA-approved machine that could that can do what these machines are doing, then they could use them to clinically ventilate COVID patients in an ICU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have a path to get this firmware through FDA, and we would apply for FDA approval under the Emergency Use Authorization if the manufacturers absolutely refused to cooperate, but the safest and best path is for the manufacturers to enable this upgrade on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately from the very pressing COVID issues, Airbreak allows CPAP device owners to write their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbreak.dev/info/extensions&quot;&gt;extensions to customize their devices for their needs&lt;/a&gt;, similar to what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://magiclantern.fm&quot;&gt;Magic Lantern&lt;/a&gt; firmware does for cameras. They can add features like the on-screen graphs shown above, or integrate external systems through the expansion port. Additionally, these tools allow the owners and users to gain a better understand their own therapy by gaining access to the sensors on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-details&quot;&gt;More details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re happy to announce we’re making private repositories with unlimited collaborators available to all GitHub accounts. &lt;strong&gt;All of the core GitHub features are now free for everyone.&lt;/strong&gt; 🎉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until now, if your organization wanted to use GitHub for private development, you had to subscribe to one of our paid plans. But every developer on earth should have access to GitHub. Price shouldn’t be a barrier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means teams can now manage their work together in one place: CI/CD, project management, code review, packages, and more. We want everyone to be able to ship great software on the platform developers love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teams who need advanced features (like code owners), enterprise features (like SAML), or personalized support can upgrade to one of our paid plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re also reducing the price of our paid Team plan from $9 per user/month to $4 per user/month, effective immediately. Existing customers will have their bills automatically reduced going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learn more in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/faq-about-changes-to-githubs-plans&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or compare plans on our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/pricing&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pricing page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>UTF-8 Everywhere</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://utf8everywhere.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;nav class=&quot;languageBar&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/zh-cn&quot;&gt;中文（中国）&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/he&quot;&gt;עברית&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;Manifesto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;rightFloater&quot;&gt;This document contains special characters. Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to promote usage and support of the UTF-8 encoding and to convince that it should be the default choice of encoding for storing text strings in memory or on disk, for communication and all other uses. We believe that our approach improves performance, reduces complexity of software and helps prevent many Unicode-related bugs. We suggest that other encodings of Unicode (or text, in general) belong to rare edge-cases of optimization and should be avoided by mainstream users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we believe that the very popular UTF-16 encoding (often mistakenly referred to as ‘widechar’ or simply ‘Unicode’ in the Windows world) has no place in library APIs except for specialized text processing libraries, e.g. ICU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document also recommends choosing UTF-8 for internal string representation in Windows applications, despite the fact that this standard is less popular there, both due to historical reasons and the lack of native UTF-8 support by the API. We believe that, even on this platform, the following arguments outweigh the lack of native support. Also, we recommend forgetting forever what ‘ANSI codepages’ are and what they were used for. It is in the user’s bill of rights to mix any number of languages in any text string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the industry, many localization-related bugs have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt; on programmers’ lack of knowledge in Unicode. We, however, believe that for an application that is not supposed to specialize in text, the infrastructure can and should make it possible for the program to be unaware of encoding issues. For instance, a file copy utility should not be written differently to support non-English file names. In this manifesto, we will also explain what a programmer should be doing if they do not want to dive into all complexities of Unicode and do not really care about &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#cookie&quot;&gt;what’s inside the string&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we would like to suggest that counting or otherwise iterating over Unicode code points should not be seen as a particularly important task in text processing scenarios. Many developers mistakenly see code points as a kind of a successor to ASCII characters. This lead to software design decisions such as Python’s string O(1) code point access. The truth, however, is that Unicode is inherently more complicated and there is no universal definition of such thing as &lt;em&gt;Unicode character&lt;/em&gt;. We see no particular reason to favor Unicode code points over Unicode grapheme clusters, code units or perhaps even words in a language for that. On the other hand, seeing UTF-8 code units (bytes) as a basic unit of text seems particularly useful for many tasks, such as parsing commonly used textual data formats. This is due to a particular feature of this encoding. Graphemes, code units, code points and other relevant Unicode terms are explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#characters&quot;&gt;Section 5&lt;/a&gt;. Operations on encoded text strings are discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#textops&quot;&gt;Section 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1988, Joseph D. Becker published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf&quot;&gt;first Unicode draft proposal&lt;/a&gt;. At the basis of his design was the naïve assumption that 16 bits per character would suffice. In 1991, the first version of the Unicode standard was published, with code points limited to 16 bits. In the following years many systems have added support for Unicode and switched to the UCS-2 encoding. It was especially attractive for new technologies, such as the Qt framework (1992), Windows NT 3.1 (1993) and Java (1995).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it was soon discovered that 16 bits per character will not do for Unicode. In 1996, the UTF-16 encoding was created so existing systems would be able to work with non-16-bit characters. This effectively nullified the rationale behind choosing 16-bit encoding in the first place, namely being a fixed-width encoding. Currently Unicode spans over 109449 characters, about 74500 of them being CJK ideographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/data/nagoya-museum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A little child playing an encodings game in front of a large poster about encodings.&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagoya City Science Museum. Photo by Vadim Zlotnik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has often mistakenly used ‘Unicode’ and ‘widechar’ as synonyms for both ‘UCS-2’ and ‘UTF-16’. Furthermore, since UTF-8 cannot be set as the encoding for narrow string WinAPI, one must compile his code with &lt;code&gt;UNICODE&lt;/code&gt; define. Windows C++ programmers are educated that Unicode must be done with ‘widechars’ (Or worse—the compiler setting-dependent TCHARs, which allow programmer to opt-out from supporting all Unicode code points). As a result of this mess, many Windows programmers are now quite confused about what is the right thing to do about text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in the Linux and the Web worlds, there is a silent agreement that UTF-8 is the best encoding to use for Unicode. Even though it provides shorter representation for English and therefore to computer languages (such as C++, HTML, XML, etc) over any other text, it is seldom less efficient than UTF-16 for commonly used character sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In both UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings, code points may take up to 4 bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UTF-8 is endianness independent. UTF-16 comes in two flavors: UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE (for the two different byte orders, respectively). Here we name them collectively as UTF-16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widechar is 2 bytes in size on some platforms, 4 on others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UTF-8 and UTF-32 yield the same order when sorted lexicographically. UTF-16 does not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UTF-8 favors efficiency for English letters and other ASCII characters (one byte per character) while UTF-16 favors several Asian character sets (2 bytes instead of 3 in UTF-8). This is what made UTF-8 the favorite choice in the Web world, where English HTML/XML tags are intermixed with any-language text. Cyrillic, Hebrew and several other popular Unicode blocks are 2 bytes both in UTF-16 and UTF-8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UTF-16 is often misused as a fixed-width encoding, even by the Windows package programs themselves: in plain Windows edit control (until Vista), it takes two backspaces to delete a character which takes 4 bytes in UTF-16. On Windows 7, the console displays such characters as two invalid characters, regardless of the font being used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many third-party libraries for Windows do not support Unicode: they accept narrow string parameters and pass them to the ANSI API. Sometimes, even for file names. In the general case, it is impossible to work around this, as a string may not be representable completely in any ANSI code page (if it contains characters from a mix of Unicode blocks). What is normally done by Windows programmers for file names is getting an 8.3 path to the file (if it already exists) and feeding it into such a library. It is not possible if the library is supposed to create a non-existing file. It is not possible if the path is very long and the 8.3 form is longer than &lt;code&gt;MAX_PATH&lt;/code&gt;. It is not possible if short-name generation is disabled in OS settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In C++, there is no way to return Unicode from &lt;code&gt;std::exception::what()&lt;/code&gt; other than using UTF-8. There is no way to support Unicode for &lt;code&gt;localeconv&lt;/code&gt; other than using UTF-8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UTF-16 remains popular today, even outside the Windows world. Qt, Java, C#, Python (prior to the CPython v3.3 reference implementation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.python&quot;&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode&quot;&gt;ICU&lt;/a&gt;—they all use UTF-16 for internal string representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the file copy utility. In the UNIX world, narrow strings are considered UTF-8 by default almost everywhere. Because of that, the author of the file copy utility would not need to care about Unicode. Once tested on ASCII strings for file name arguments, it would work correctly for file names in any language, as arguments are treated as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_data_type&quot;&gt;cookies&lt;/a&gt;. The code of the file copy utility would not need to change &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; to support foreign languages. &lt;code&gt;fopen()&lt;/code&gt; would accept Unicode seamlessly, and so would &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s see how to do this on Microsoft Windows, a UTF-16 based architecture. To make a file copy utility that can accept file names in a mix of several different Unicode blocks (languages) here requires advanced trickery. First, the application must be compiled as Unicode-aware. In this case, it cannot have &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function with standard-C parameters. It will then accept UTF-16 encoded &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;. To convert a Windows program written with narrow text in mind to support Unicode, one has to refactor deep and to take care of each and every string variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard library shipped with MSVC is poorly implemented with respect to Unicode support. It forwards narrow-string parameters directly to the OS ANSI API. There is no way to override this. Changing &lt;code&gt;std::locale&lt;/code&gt; does not work. It’s impossible to open a file with a Unicode name on MSVC using standard features of C++. The standard way to open a file is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;std::fstream fout(&quot;abc.txt&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper way to get around is by using Microsoft’s own hack that accepts wide-string parameter, which is a non-standard extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows, the &lt;code&gt;HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\CodePage\ACP&lt;/code&gt; registry key enables receiving non-ASCII characters, but only from a single ANSI codepage. An unimplemented value of 65001 would probably resolve the cookie issue, on Windows. If Microsoft implements support of this &lt;abbr title=&quot;ANSI Code Page&quot;&gt;ACP&lt;/abbr&gt; value, this will help wider adoption of UTF-8 on Windows platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Windows programmers and multi-platform library vendors, we further discuss our approach to handling text strings and refactoring programs for better Unicode support in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#windows&quot;&gt;How to do text on Windows&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt of the definitions regarding characters, code points, code units and grapheme clusters according to the Unicode Standard with our comments. You are encouraged to refer to the relevant sections of the standard for a more detailed description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;rightFloater&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;display&quot;&gt;Приве́т नमस्ते שָׁלוֹם&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many &lt;em&gt;characters&lt;/em&gt; do you see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;dl readability=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Code point&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Any numerical value in the Unicode codespace.&lt;sup&gt;[§3.4, D10]&lt;/sup&gt; For instance: U+3243F.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Code unit&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The minimal bit combination that can represent a unit of encoded text.&lt;sup&gt;[§3.9, D77]&lt;/sup&gt; For example, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 use 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit code units respectively. The above code point will be encoded as four code units ‘&lt;code&gt;f0 b2 90 bf&lt;/code&gt;’ in UTF-8, two code units ‘&lt;code&gt;d889 dc3f&lt;/code&gt;’ in UTF-16 and as a single code unit ‘&lt;code&gt;0003243f&lt;/code&gt;’ in UTF-32. Note that these are just sequences of &lt;em&gt;groups of bits&lt;/em&gt;; how they are stored on an octet-oriented media depends on the endianness of the particular encoding. When storing the above UTF-16 code units, they will be converted to ‘&lt;code&gt;d8 89 dc 3f&lt;/code&gt;’ in UTF-16BE and to ‘&lt;code&gt;89 d8 3f dc&lt;/code&gt;’ in UTF-16LE.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Abstract character&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit of information used for the organization, control, or representation of textual data.&lt;sup&gt;[§3.4, D7]&lt;/sup&gt; The standard further says in §3.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Unicode Standard, [...] the repertoire is inherently open. Because Unicode is a universal encoding, any abstract character that could ever be encoded is a potential candidate to be encoded, regardless of whether the character is currently known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition is indeed abstract. Whatever one can think of as a character—&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an abstract character. For example, &lt;img src=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/data/glyph-ungwe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;tengwar letter ungwe&lt;/em&gt; is an abstract character, although it is not yet representable in Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Encoded character&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Coded character&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mapping between a code point and an abstract character.&lt;sup&gt;[§3.4, D11]&lt;/sup&gt; For example, U+1F428 is a coded character which represents the abstract character 🐨 &lt;span class=&quot;uniname&quot;&gt;koala&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mapping is neither total, nor injective, nor surjective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surragates, noncharacters and unassigned code points do not correspond to abstract characters at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some abstract characters can be encoded by different code points; U+03A9 &lt;span class=&quot;uniname&quot;&gt;greek capital letter omega&lt;/span&gt; and U+2126 &lt;span class=&quot;uniname&quot;&gt;ohm sign&lt;/span&gt; both correspond to the same abstract character ‘Ω’, and &lt;em&gt;must be treated identically&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some abstract characters cannot be encoded by a single code point. These are represented by &lt;em&gt;sequences&lt;/em&gt; of coded characters. For example, the only way to represent the abstract character ю́ &lt;em&gt;cyrillic small letter yu with acute&lt;/em&gt; is by the sequence U+044E &lt;span class=&quot;uniname&quot;&gt;cyrillic small letter yu&lt;/span&gt; followed by U+0301 &lt;span class=&quot;uniname&quot;&gt;combining acute accent&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, for some abstract characters, there exist representations using multiple code points, &lt;em&gt;in addition&lt;/em&gt; to the single coded character form. The abstract character ǵ can be coded by the single code point U+01F5 &lt;span class=&quot;uniname&quot;&gt;latin small letter g with acute&lt;/span&gt;, or by the sequence &amp;lt;U+0067 &lt;span class=&quot;uniname&quot;&gt;latin small letter g&lt;/span&gt;, U+0301 &lt;span class=&quot;uniname&quot;&gt;combining acute accent&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;User-perceived character&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Whatever the end user thinks of as a character. This notion is language dependent. For instance, ‘ch’ is two letters in English and Latin, but considered to be one letter in Czech and Slovak.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Grapheme cluster&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A sequence of coded characters that ‘should be kept together’.&lt;sup&gt;[§2.11]&lt;/sup&gt; Grapheme clusters approximate the notion of user-perceived characters in a language independent way. They are used for, e.g., cursor movement and selection.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Glyph&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A particular shape within a font. Fonts are collections of glyphs designed by a type designer. It’s the text shaping and rendering engine responsibility to convert a sequence of code points into a sequence of glyphs within the specified font. The rules for this conversion might be complicated, locale dependent, and are beyond the scope of the Unicode standard.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Character’ may refer to any of the above. The Unicode Standard uses it as a synonym for &lt;em&gt;coded character&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;[§3.4]&lt;/sup&gt; When a programming language or a library documentation says ‘character’, it typically means a code unit. When an end user is asked about the number of characters in a string, he will count the user-perceived characters. A programmer might count characters as code units, code points, or grapheme clusters, according to the level of the programmer’s Unicode expertise. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/counting-characters.html&quot;&gt;this is how Twitter counts characters&lt;/a&gt;. In our opinion, a string length function should not necessarily return one for the string ‘🐨’ to be considered Unicode-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, most Unicode code points take the same number of bytes in UTF-8 and in UTF-16. This includes Russian, Hebrew, Greek and all non-BMP code points take 2 or 4 bytes in both encodings. Latin letters, together with punctuation marks and the rest of ASCII take more space in UTF-16, while some Asian characters take more in UTF-8. Couldn’t Asian programmers, theoretically, object dumping UTF-16—which saves them 50% of the memory per character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s reality. Saving half the memory is true only in artificially constructed examples containing only characters in the U+0800 to U+FFFF range. However, computer-to-computer text interfaces dominate over all other usages of text. This includes XML, HTTP, filesystem paths and configuration files—they all use almost exclusively ASCII characters, and in fact UTF-8 is very popular in respective Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a dedicated storage of Chinese books, UTF-16 may still be used as a fair optimization. As soon as the text is retrieved from such storage, it should be converted to the standard compatible with the rest of the world. In either case, if storage is at premium, a lossless compression will be used. In such cases, UTF-8 and UTF-16 will take roughly the same space. Furthermore, ‘in the said languages, a glyph conveys more information than a [L]atin character so it is justified for it to take more space.’ (Tronic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/102211/34925&quot;&gt;UTF-16 considered harmful&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of a simple experiment. The space used by the HTML source of some web page (&lt;em&gt;Japan&lt;/em&gt; article, retrieved from the Japanese Wikipedia on 2012–01–01) is shown in the first column. The second column shows the results for text with markup removed, that is ‘select all, copy, paste into plain text file’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;basicTable&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th/&gt;
&lt;th&gt;HTML Source (Δ UTF-8)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Dense text (Δ UTF-8)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;UTF-8&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;767 KB (0%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;222 KB (0%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;UTF-16&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 186 KB (+55%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;176 KB (−21%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;UTF-8 zipped&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;179 KB (−77%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;83 KB (−63%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;UTF-16LE zipped&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192 KB (−75%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;76 KB (−66%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;UTF-16BE zipped&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;194 KB (−75%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;77 KB (−65%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, UTF-16 takes about 50% more space than UTF-8 on real data, it only saves 20% for dense Asian text, and hardly competes with general purpose compression algorithms. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/zh-cn&quot;&gt;Chinese translation&lt;/a&gt; of this manifesto takes 58.8 KiB in UTF-16, and only 51.7 KiB in UTF-8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular text-based data formats (e.g. CSV, XML, HTML, JSON, RTF and source codes of computer programs) often contain ASCII characters as structure control elements and may contain both ASCII and non-ASCII text data strings. Working with a variable length encoding, where ASCII-inherited code points are shorter than other code points may seem like a difficult task, because encoded character boundaries within the string are not immediately known. This has driven software architects to opt for UCS-4 fixed-width encoding. (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.python&quot;&gt;Python v3.3&lt;/a&gt;). In fact, this is both unnecessary and does not solve any real problem we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design of this encoding, UTF-8 guarantees that an ASCII character value or a substring will never match a part of a multi-byte encoded character. The same is true for UTF-16. In both encodings, the code units of multi-part encoded code point will have &lt;abbr title=&quot;Most Significant Bit&quot;&gt;MSB&lt;/abbr&gt; set to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find, say, ‘&amp;lt;’ sign marking a beginning of an HTML tag, or an apostrophe (') in a UTF-8 encoded SQL statement to defend against an SQL injection, do as you would for an all-English plaintext ASCII string. The encoding guarantees this to work. Specifically, that every non-ASCII character is encoded in UTF-8 as a sequence of bytes, each of them having a value greater than 127. This leaves no place for collision for a naïve algorithm—simple, fast and elegant, and no need to care about encoded character boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you can search for a non-ASCII, UTF-8 encoded substring in a UTF-8 string as if it was a plain byte array—there is no need to mind code point boundaries. This is thanks to another design feature of UTF-8—a leading byte of an encoded code point can never hold value corresponding to one of trailing bytes of any other code point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we already noted, there is a popular idea that counting, splitting, indexing or otherwise iterating over code points in a Unicode string should be considered a frequent and important operation. In this section, we review this in further detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth.utf16.o1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.utf16.o1&quot;&gt;1. Counting characters can be done in constant time with UTF-16.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common mistake by those who think that UTF-16 is a fixed-width encoding. It is not. In fact UTF-16 is a variable length encoding. Refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.almostfw&quot;&gt;this FAQ&lt;/a&gt; if you deny the existence of non-BMP characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth.utf32.o1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.utf32.o1&quot;&gt;2. Counting characters can be done in constant time with UTF-32.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depends on the meaning of the misused word ‘character’. It is true that we can count code units and code points in constant time in UTF-32. However, code points do not correspond to user-perceived characters. Even in the Unicode formalism some code points correspond to &lt;em&gt;coded character&lt;/em&gt; and some to &lt;em&gt;non-characters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth.strlen&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.strlen&quot;&gt;3. Counting coded characters or code points is important.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that the importance of code points is frequently overstated. This is due to common misunderstanding of the complexity of Unicode, which merely reflects the complexity of human languages. It is easy to tell how many characters are there in ‘Abracadabra’, but let’s go back to the following string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;display&quot;&gt;Приве́т नमस्ते שָׁלוֹם&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consists of 22 (!) code points, but only 16 grapheme clusters. It may be reduced to 20 code points if converted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/&quot;&gt;NFC&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, the number of code points in it is irrelevant to almost any software engineering task, with perhaps the only exception of converting the string to UTF-32. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For cursor movement, text selection and alike, &lt;em&gt;grapheme clusters&lt;/em&gt; shall be used. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For limiting the length of a string in input fields, file formats, protocols, or databases, the length is measured in &lt;em&gt;code units&lt;/em&gt; of some predetermined encoding. The reason is that any length limit is derived from the fixed amount of memory allocated for the string at a lower level, be it in memory, disk or in a particular data structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The size of the string as it appears on the screen is unrelated to the number of code points in the string. One has to communicate with the rendering engine for this. Code points do not occupy one column even in monospace fonts and terminals. POSIX takes this into account. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth.nfc&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.nfc&quot;&gt;4. In NFC each code point corresponds to one user-perceived character.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, because the number of user-perceived characters that can be represented in Unicode is virtually infinite. Even in practice, most characters do not have a fully composed form. For example, the NFD string from the example above, which consists of three &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; words in three &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; languages, will consist of 20 code points in NFC. This is still far more than the 16 user-perceived characters it has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth.strlen.correctness&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.strlen.correctness&quot;&gt;5. The string &lt;code&gt;length()&lt;/code&gt; operation must count user-perceived or coded characters. If not, it does not support Unicode properly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicode support of libraries and programming languages is frequently judged by the value returned for the ‘length of the string’ operation. According to this evaluation of Unicode support, most popular languages, such as C#, Java, and even the ICU itself, would not support Unicode. For example, the length of the one character string ‘🐨’ will be often reported to be 2 where UTF-16 is used as for the internal string representation and 4 for the languages that internally use UTF-8. The source of the misconception is that the specification of these languages use the word ‘character’ to mean a code unit, while the programmer expects it to be something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the code unit count returned by those APIs is of the highest practical importance. When writing a UTF-8 string to a file, it is the length in bytes which is important. Counting any other type of ‘characters’ is, on the other hand, not very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UTF-16 is the worst of both worlds, being both variable length and too wide. It exists only for historical reasons and creates a lot of confusion. We hope that its usage will further decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portability, cross-platform interoperability and simplicity are more important than interoperability with existing platform APIs. So, the best approach is to use UTF-8 narrow strings everywhere and convert them back and forth when using platform APIs that don’t support UTF-8 and accept wide strings (e.g. Windows API). &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.cvt.perf&quot;&gt;Performance is seldom an issue&lt;/a&gt; of any relevance when dealing with string-accepting system APIs (e.g. UI code and file system APIs), and there is a great advantage to using the same encoding everywhere else in the application, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.liberal&quot;&gt;we see no sufficient reason to do otherwise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of performance, machines often use strings to communicate (e.g. HTTP headers, XML, SOAP). Many see this as a mistake by itself, but regardless of that it is nearly always done in English and ASCII, giving UTF-8 further advantage there. Using different encodings for different kinds of strings significantly increases complexity and resulting bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we believe that adding &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt; to the C++ standard was a mistake, and so are the Unicode additions to C++11. What must be demanded from the implementations though, is that the &lt;em&gt;basic execution character set&lt;/em&gt; would be capable of storing any Unicode data. Then, every &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; parameter would be Unicode-compatible. ‘If this accepts text, it should be Unicode compatible’—and with UTF-8, it is easy to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/locale/doc/html/rationale.html&quot;&gt;The standard facets have many design flaws&lt;/a&gt;. This includes &lt;code&gt;std::numpunct&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::moneypunct&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::ctype&lt;/code&gt; not supporting variable-length encoded characters (non-ASCII UTF-8 and non-BMP UTF-16), or not having the information to perform the conversions. They must be fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;decimal_point()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;thousands_sep()&lt;/code&gt; shall return a string rather than a single code unit. This is how C locales do this through the &lt;code&gt;localeconv&lt;/code&gt; function, albeit not customizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;toupper()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tolower()&lt;/code&gt; shall not be phrased in terms of code units, as it does not work in Unicode. For example, the Latin ﬄ ligature must be converted to FFL and the German ß to SS (there is a capital form ẞ, but the casing rules follow the traditional ones). In addition, some languages (e.g. Greek) have special final forms of some lower case letters, so case conversion routines must be aware of their position to perform the conversion correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is dedicated to developing multi-platform library development and to Windows programming. The problem with Windows platform is that it does not (yet) support Unicode-compatible narrow string system APIs. The only way to pass Unicode strings to Windows API is by converting to UTF-16 (also known as wide strings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that our guidelines differ significantly from the Microsoft’s original guide to Unicode conversion. Our approach based on performing the wide string conversion as close to API calls as possible, and never holding wide string data. In the previous sections we explained that this will typically result in better performance, stability, code simplicity and interoperability with other software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1.4758429793659&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not use &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;std::wstring&lt;/code&gt; in any place other than adjacent point to APIs accepting UTF-16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use &lt;code&gt;_T(&quot;&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;L&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; literals in any place other than parameters to APIs accepting UTF-16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use types, functions, or their derivatives that are sensitive to the &lt;code&gt;UNICODE&lt;/code&gt; constant, such as &lt;code&gt;LPTSTR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CreateWindow()&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;_T()&lt;/code&gt;macro. Instead, use &lt;code&gt;LPWSTR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CreateWindowW()&lt;/code&gt; and explicit &lt;code&gt;L&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; literals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, &lt;code&gt;UNICODE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_UNICODE&lt;/code&gt; are always defined, to avoid passing narrow UTF-8 strings to ANSI WinAPI getting silently compiled. This can be done by VS project settings, under code name &lt;em&gt;Use Unicode character set&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; variables are considered UTF-8, anywhere in the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have the privilege of writing in C++, the &lt;code&gt;narrow()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;widen()&lt;/code&gt; conversion functions below can be handy for inline conversion syntax. Of course, any other UTF-8/UTF-16 coversion code would do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.88965517241379&quot;&gt;Only use Win32 functions that accept widechars (&lt;code&gt;LPWSTR&lt;/code&gt;), never those which accept &lt;code&gt;LPTSTR&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LPSTR&lt;/code&gt;. Pass parameters this way:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;::SetWindowTextW(widen(someStdString or &quot;string litteral&quot;).c_str())&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The policy uses conversion functions described below. See also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.cvt.perf&quot;&gt;a note on conversion performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;With MFC strings:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;CString someoneElse; // something that arrived from MFC.

// Converted as soon as possible, before passing any further away from the API call:
std::string s = str(boost::format(&quot;Hello %s\n&quot;) % narrow(someoneElse));
AfxMessageBox(widen(s).c_str(), L&quot;Error&quot;, MB_OK);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For .NET developers: using the native UTF-16 based string class may be hard to avoid. Remember that this implementation detail leaks heavily through the interface of this class. For example, &lt;code&gt;string[index]&lt;/code&gt; operation may return part of a character (as it would be with a UTF-8 byte array). When serializing strings into output files or communication devices, remember to specify &lt;code&gt;Encoding.UTF8&lt;/code&gt;. Be ready to pay the performance penalities for conversion, e.g. in ASP.NET web applications, which typically generate UTF-8 HTML output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;how.files&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#how.files&quot;&gt;Working with files, filenames and fstreams on Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how.cvt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#how.cvt&quot;&gt;Conversion functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guideline uses the conversion functions from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cppcms.com/files/nowide/html/&quot;&gt;Boost.Nowide library&lt;/a&gt; (it is not yet a part of boost):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;std::string narrow(const wchar_t *s);
std::wstring widen(const char *s);
std::string narrow(const std::wstring &amp;amp;s);
std::wstring widen(const std::string &amp;amp;s);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library also provides a set of wrappers for commonly used standard C and C++ library functions that deal with files, as well as means of reading and writing UTF-8 through iostreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These functions and wrappers are easy to implement using Windows’ &lt;code&gt;MultiByteToWideChar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WideCharToMultiByte&lt;/code&gt; functions. Any other (possibly faster) conversion routines can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: No, and my country is non-ASCII speaking. I do not think that using a format which encodes ASCII characters in single byte is Anglo-centrism, or has anything to do with human interaction. Even though one can argue that source codes of programs, web pages and XML files, OS file names and other computer-to-computer text interfaces should never have existed, as long as they do exist, text is not always composed for human audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: This is false. Both C# and Java offer a 16 bit &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type, which is less than a Unicode character, congratulations. The .NET indexer &lt;code&gt;str[i]&lt;/code&gt; works in units of the internal representation, hence a leaky abstraction once again. Substring methods will happily return an invalid string, cutting a non-BMP character in parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, you have to mind encodings when you are writing your text to files on disk, network communications, external devices, or any place for other program to read from. Please be kind to use &lt;code&gt;System.Text.Encoding.UTF8&lt;/code&gt; (.NET) in these cases, never &lt;code&gt;Encoding.ASCII&lt;/code&gt;, UTF-16 or cellphone PDU, regardless of the assumptions about the contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web frameworks like ASP.NET do suffer from the poor choice of internal string representation in the underlying framework: the expected string output (and input) of a web application is nearly always UTF-8, resulting in significant conversion overhead in high-throughput web applications and web services.&lt;/p&gt;

This practically makes UTF-16 a fixed-width encoding, giving it a whole bunch of advantages. Can’t we just neglect these characters?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Are you serious about not supporting all of Unicode in your software design? And, if you are going to support it anyway, how does the fact that non-BMP characters are rare practically change anything, except for making software testing harder? What does matter, however, is that text manipulations are relatively rare in real applications—compared to just passing strings around as-is. This means the &quot;almost fixed width&quot; has little performance advantage (see Performance), while having shorter strings may be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: We have nothing against correct usage of any encoding. However, it becomes a problem when the same type, such as &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;, means different things in different contexts. While it is ‘ANSI codepage’ for some, for others, it means ‘this code is broken and does not support non-English text’. In our programs, it means Unicode-aware UTF-8 string. This diversity is a source of many bugs and much misery. This additional complexity is something the world does not really need. The result is lots of Unicode-broken software, industry-wide. JoelOnSoftware &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that having every programmer be aware of encodings is the solution to Unicode-broken software. We believe that with one mainstream encoding becoming the default for software APIs, one will be able to write a correct file copy program &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#cookie&quot;&gt;without being an expert in text and language issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Why should I convert strings back and forth all the time for Windows API calls, instead of simply using wide state variables?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a valid shortcut. Indeed, it may be a legitimate case for using wide strings. But, if you are planning to add some configuration or a log file in future, please consider converting the whole thing to narrow strings. That would be future-proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: This is an additional safety mechanism against plugging a UTF-8 &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; string into ANSI-expecting function variants of Windows API. We want it to generate a compiler error. It is the same kind of a hard-to-find bug as passing an &lt;code&gt;argv[]&lt;/code&gt; string to &lt;code&gt;fopen()&lt;/code&gt; on Windows: it assumes that the user will never pass non-current-codepage filenames. You will be unlikely to find this kind of a bug by manual testing, unless your testers are trained to supply Chinese file names occasionally, and yet it is a broken program logic. Thanks to the &lt;code&gt;UNICODE&lt;/code&gt; define, you get a compiler error for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.naive&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.naive&quot;&gt;Q: Isn’t it quite naïve to think that Microsoft will stop using widechars one day?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Let’s first see when they start supporting &lt;code&gt;CP_UTF8&lt;/code&gt; as a valid codepage. This should not be very hard to do. Then, we see no reason why any Windows developer would continue using the widechar APIs. Also, adding support for &lt;code&gt;CP_UTF8&lt;/code&gt; would ‘unbreak’ some of existing unicode-broken programs and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say that adding &lt;code&gt;CP_UTF8&lt;/code&gt; support would &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt; existing applications that use the ANSI API, and that this was supposedly the reason why Microsoft had to resort to creating the wide string API. This is not true. Even some popular ANSI encodings are variable length (Shift JIS, for example), so no correct code would become broken. The reason Microsoft chose UCS-2 is purely historical. Back then UTF-8 hasn’t yet existed, Unicode was believed to be ‘just a wider ASCII’, and it was considered important to use a fixed-width encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: According to the Unicode Standard (v6.2, p.30): &lt;q&gt;Use of a BOM is neither required nor recommended for UTF-8&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byte order issues are yet another reason to avoid UTF-16. UTF-8 has no endianness issues, and the UTF-8 BOM exists only to manifest that this is a UTF-8 stream. If UTF-8 remains the only popular encoding (as it already is in the internet world), the BOM becomes redundant. In practice, most UTF-8 text files omit BOMs today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using BOMs would require all existing code to be aware of them, even in simple scenarios as file concatenation. This is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Always use &lt;code&gt;\n (0x0a)&lt;/code&gt; line endings, even on Windows. Files should be read and written in binary mode, which guarantees interoperability—a program will always give the same output on any system. Since the C and C++ standards use &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; as in-memory line endings, this will cause all files to be written in the POSIX convention. It may cause trouble when the file is opened in Notepad on Windows; however, any decent text editor understands such line endings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Is it really better with UTF-16? Maybe so. ICU uses UTF-16 for historical reasons, thus it is quite hard to measure. However, most of the times strings are treated as cookies, not sorted or reversed every second use. A denser encoding is then favorable for performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.utf16.fault&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.utf16.fault&quot;&gt;Q: Is it really a fault of UTF-16 that people misuse it, assuming that it is 16 bits per character?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Not really. But yes, safety is an important feature of every design, and encodings are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.confuse&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.confuse&quot;&gt;Q: If &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; means UTF-8, wouldn’t that get confused with code that stores plain text in &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;s?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: There is no such thing as plain text. There is no reason for storing codepage-ANSI or ASCII-only text in a class named ‘string’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.cvt.perf&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.cvt.perf&quot;&gt;Q: Won’t the conversions between UTF-8 and UTF-16 when passing strings to Windows slow down my application?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: First, you will do &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; conversion either way. It’s either when calling the system, or when interacting with the rest of the world, e.g. when sending a text string over TCP. Also, those of OS APIs which accept strings often perform tasks which are inherently slow, such as UI or file system operations. If your interaction with the system APIs dominate your application, here is a little experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One typical use of the OS APIs is to open files. This function executes in (184 ± 3)μs on my machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;void f(const wchar_t* name)
{
    HANDLE f = CreateFile(name, GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ, 0, CREATE_ALWAYS, 0, 0);
    DWORD written;
    WriteFile(f, &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;, 13, &amp;amp;written, 0);
    CloseHandle(f);
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this runs in (186 ± 0.7)μs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;void f(const char* name)
{
    HANDLE f = CreateFile(widen(name).c_str(), GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ, 0, CREATE_ALWAYS, 0, 0);
    DWORD written;
    WriteFile(f, &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;, 13, &amp;amp;written, 0);
    CloseHandle(f);
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Run with &lt;code&gt;name=&quot;D:\\a\\test\\subdir\\subsubdir\\this is the sub dir\\a.txt&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in both cases. It was averaged over 5 runs. We used an optimized &lt;code&gt;widen&lt;/code&gt; that relies on &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; contiguous storage guarantee given by C++11.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just (1 ± 2)% overhead. Also, &lt;code&gt;MultiByteToWideChar&lt;/code&gt; is not the fastest UTF-8↔UTF-16 conversion function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;19.817518248175&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.literal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.literal&quot;&gt;Q: How do I write UTF-8 string literal in my C++ code?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: If you internationalize your software then all non-ASCII strings will be loaded from an external translation database, so it is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still want to embed a special character you can do it as follows. In C++11 you can do it as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;display&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;u8&quot;∃y ∀x ¬(x ≺ y)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With compilers that do not support ‘u8’ you can hard-code the UTF-8 code units as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;display&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;\xE2\x88\x83y \xE2\x88\x80x \xC2\xAC(x \xE2\x89\xBA y)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the most straightforward way is to just write the string as-is and save the source file encoded in UTF-8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;display&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;∃y ∀x ¬(x ≺ y)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, MSVC converts it to some ANSI codepage, corrupting the string. To work around this, save the file in UTF-8 &lt;em&gt;without BOM&lt;/em&gt;. MSVC will assume that it is in the correct codepage and will not touch your strings. However, it renders it impossible to use Unicode identifiers and wide string literals (that you will not be using anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.convert&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.convert&quot;&gt;Q: I have a complex large char-based Windows application. What is the easiest way to make it Unicode-aware?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the chars. Define &lt;code&gt;UNICODE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_UNICODE&lt;/code&gt; to get compiler errors where &lt;code&gt;narrow()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;widen()&lt;/code&gt; should be used (this is done automatically by setting &lt;strong&gt;Use Unicode Character Set&lt;/strong&gt; in Visual Studio project settings). Find all &lt;code&gt;fstream&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fopen()&lt;/code&gt; uses, and use wide overloads as described above. By now, you are almost done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use 3rd-party libraries that do not support Unicode, e.g. forwarding file name strings as-is to &lt;code&gt;fopen()&lt;/code&gt;, you will have to work around with tools such as &lt;code&gt;GetShortPathName()&lt;/code&gt; as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;30.275647668394&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.python&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.python&quot;&gt;Q: What about Python? I heard they worked hard in v3.3 to support Unicode better.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Perhaps, they should have done less and the support would have been better. In the CPython v3.3 reference implementation, the internal string representation was changed. The UTF-16 was replaced by one of three possible encodings (ISO-8859-1, UCS-2 or UCS-4) depending on the actual string content. To add a single non-ASCII or non-BMP character, the entire string will often be implicitly converted to a different encoding. The internal encoding is transparent to the script. This design is meant to &lt;em&gt;optimize the performance of indexing operations&lt;/em&gt; on Unicode code points. However, we argue that counting or indexing code points &lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#myth.strlen&quot;&gt;should not be important&lt;/a&gt; for the majority of uses—compared, for instance, to grapheme clusters. To our knowledge, Python currently provides no support of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we oppose representation-agnostic handling of strings, in favor of representation-transparent API with a UTF-8 internal representation. Indexing operations would be counting code units rather than the code points, as they in fact did before the change. This would also simplify the implementation and also improve performance, e.g. in scripts dealing with the Web, which is already dominated by UTF-8 encoded text, thus making the Python programming language more applicable in the server-side world. One may argue about the safety of string-cutting operations by script programmers, but then again, the same argument is valid for splitting grapheme clusters. Even though Unicode is now fully supported, we believe that Python, as a modern tool with less historical burden to carry, must do better job in text handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, JPython and IronPython continue to rely on the less fortunate encoding used by their hosting platforms (Java and .NET, respectively) and care must be taken to handle the surrogate pairs correctly there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.ood&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.ood&quot;&gt;Q: But why &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;? Wouldn’t it be a better, object-oriented approach to have a UTF-8 aware string class?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Not every piece of code dealing with strings is actually involved in processing and validation of text. A file copy program which receives Unicode file names and passes them to file IO routines, would do just fine with a simple byte buffer. If you design a library that accepts strings, the simple, standard and lightweight &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; would do just fine. On the contrary, it would be a mistake to reinvent a new string class and force everyone through your peculiar interface. Of course, if one needs more than just passing strings around, he should then use appropriate text processing tools. However, such tools are better to be independent of the storage class used, in the spirit of the container/algorithm separation in the STL. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/084.htm&quot;&gt;some consider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; interface too bloated, as most of it was better to be moved out of the &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6.3325942350333&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq.whats.now&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://utf8everywhere.org/#faq.whats.now&quot;&gt;Q: I already use this approach and I want to make our vision come true. What can I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review your code and see what library is most painful to use in portable Unicode-aware code. Open a bug report to the authors. If you are a C or C++ library author, use &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; with UTF-8 implied, and refuse to support ANSI code pages—since they are inherently Unicode-broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a Microsoft employee, push for implementing support of the &lt;code&gt;CP_UTF8&lt;/code&gt; as one of narrow API code pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a repository for patches of commonly used 3rd-party libraries for UTF-8 support (e.g. PugiXML, LibTIFF, etc.) These are written in standard C and do not care about Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a link-time patch for standard library functions (e.g. &lt;code&gt;fopen()&lt;/code&gt;) on Windows, which would do the proper parameter conversion. This can be done for &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; and the global environment variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This manifesto was written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://meshnotes.com/9SrRpAypTr8e&quot;&gt;Pavel Radzivilovsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stannum.io/&quot;&gt;Yakov Galka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://slavanov.com/&quot;&gt;Slava Novgorodov&lt;/a&gt;. It is a result of our experience and research of real-world Unicode issues and mistakes done by real-world programmers. Our goal here is to improve awareness of text issues and to inspire industry-wide changes to make Unicode-aware programming easier, ultimately improving the experience of users of those programs written by human engineers. Neither of us is involved in the Unicode consortium.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Valve and HackerOne: how not to handle vulnerability reports</title>
<link>https://blog.jakegealer.me/valve-a/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.jakegealer.me/valve-a/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog, but I felt like this is something I needed to get off my chest after months. If people enjoy this blog post, I will probably do more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-saga-begins&quot;&gt;The saga begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole saga begins on May 23rd 2019. After viewing the requests from my iPhone using a reverse proxy (I can't remember why I did this, but I did nonetheless), I noticed a lot of HTTP requests coming from the Steam mobile app. Out of curiosity I created a simple DNS server to run locally and redirect requests from &quot;store.steampowered.com&quot; to a Python SimpleHTTPServer instance running on port 80. From here, I was able to redirect the user on the store page whilst they wouldn't notice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.jakegealer.me/content/images/2020/03/rsz_1image0.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;My (pretty borked at the time) website being redirected to from a fake store page on the Steam mobile app from my local network. 
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty bad since it means that an attacker on the local area network can very easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/understanding-http-strict-transport/&quot;&gt;manipulate the responses&lt;/a&gt;, especially on the store page. But it should be a pretty simple fix that should likely take a week tops. Nobody would ever leave a vulnerability like that for months, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-initial-hackerone-response&quot;&gt;The initial HackerOne response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being very concerned about this obvious vulnerability, I went ahead and made a pretty detailed HackerOne request. It's important to note that this bug bounty program by Valve was HackerOne managed. This means that HackerOne process the bug bounty before Valve can even see it. I submitted a fairly detailed HackerOne ticket which should have been enough to set alarm bells ringing and get someone at Valve to see it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LdSFqX8.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;My HackerOne report&quot;/&gt;My HackerOne report
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I got the following response (after one saying they were reviewing my ticket, but this is clearly just an automated one, so skipping over that):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.jakegealer.me/content/images/2020/03/image-2.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;HackerOne staff trying to say that you required physical access to the device to MITM HTTP/DNS.
&lt;p&gt;This clearly made no sense. I would have thought it would be obvious to anyone with basic knowledge of insecure protocols that you can easily perform a man in the middle attack, so I assumed it was a mistake. I replied with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.jakegealer.me/content/images/2020/03/image-4.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;My reply to this ticket response.
&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, this HackerOne employee did give me the opportunity to explain how it could be exploited and did reopen it, so this could have been a mistake and not a systematic error. The response implied that they were unsure if Valve would close it, but I accept that this person may not understand some different attack vectors and called it a day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZWFajPI.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Me explaining to the HackerOne person how it could be exploited&quot;/&gt;Me explaining to the HackerOne person how it could be exploited
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was just waiting for Valve to respond, that can't be long, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-silent-treatment&quot;&gt;The silent treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this response, the ticket just went silent for over a week. I was getting a bit concerned that nobody has actually seen this within Valve, so I decided to post a message asking for a status update on June 6th 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1YucOM0.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Me asking for a update&quot;/&gt;Me asking for a update after a week
&lt;p&gt;After getting no response, I thought that there might be an off chance that they are not able to reproduce it as a MITM attack. I wrote a crappy few scripts to do this (I improve this script later on, but this is a botch to help them understand) and explained how it all worked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/26bPRgw.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Me explaining how to preform a MITM attack
&lt;p&gt;From here, I was pretty frustrated at getting zero responses from anyone, I went ahead and shot Valve an email on both the 13th June 2019 and the 25th June 2019 at their security email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k64kb31.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;My &quot;21 day old HackerOne report with no response&quot; email&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R8OeXuk.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;My &quot;1 month old HackerOne report with no response&quot; email
&lt;p&gt;Both of these emails received literally no response from Valve; almost as if their security email listed on their website is deprecated. I was very annoyed at this point. I attempted to get their attention on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JakeBuildsStuff/status/1139615307394375681&quot;&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JakeBuildsStuff/status/1144953807601852416&quot;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; with no success. On July 11th, I received this email which was somewhat positive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.jakegealer.me/content/images/2020/03/image-6.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The response I received out of the blue.
&lt;p&gt;After seeing this, I decided to wait until the 11th August to see if they were actually going to standby responding. A month seemed reasonable after this email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hitting-the-brick-wall-again&quot;&gt;Hitting the brick wall again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was the 30th August and I was pretty tired of this since it was way over a month. So I decided to tweet them saying I would release it if I didn't get a response. This worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;7.3540372670807&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hey &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Hacker0x01?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Hacker0x01&lt;/a&gt; , I have an over 3-month-old exploit for Steam which I contacted them on your service about (and your support tried to expedite for me). I tried contacting your support about any mechanisms for publicly disclosing if a company doesn't respond in a reasonable 1/2&lt;/p&gt;
— Jake (@JakeBuildsStuff) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JakeBuildsStuff/status/1167552926212067328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 30, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 The tweet sent to HackerOne.
&lt;p&gt;I immediately got an email response. This is amazing, I've been waiting for something after that last response for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TlGKpxx.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The e-mail I got after the tweet.
&lt;p&gt;I then followed up to this person because they felt (and I believe they were trying to do everything in their power so are) very genuine. By this point, I responded telling him I would wait off on releasing anything publicly. My attempts were only to get this patched, not to cause Valve issues after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sHQlRgT.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Me thanking the person for their response.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;valve-is-typing-&quot;&gt;Valve is typing...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, I received this response from HackerOne claiming there was a mixup in the process with Valve and that my bug report was a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NsOI1Ur.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Saying my report is a duplicate
&lt;p&gt;This honestly scares the crap out of me. This means 1 of 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They're trying to get out of paying bug bounty money:&lt;/strong&gt; I guess this is the more extreme perspective to take here, but considering the whole experience, a definitely possible one. I wasn't here for the bug bounty money, I have work by this point, but if there's some younger child trying to get into security research doing this, this could be enough to massively demotivate them if they were promised it from the HackerOne page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They had someone who posted the same bug either weeks or months in advance:&lt;/strong&gt; This means that Valve left someone else hanging for an insanely long time. This is equally messed up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then receive this response duo on the HackerOne page on August 31st 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.jakegealer.me/content/images/2020/03/image-5.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Responses on HackerOne issue (top one HackerOne staff, bottom one Valve)
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting because the HackerOne staff member seems to be completely unaware about the risks of MITM attacks, but the Valve staff member rapidly replies to say that whilst it's a duplicate it's a valid issue. What does scare me about what the Valve staff member said is that they have not yet deployed a fix. For a simple MITM exploit that can be fixed by replacing &quot;http://&quot; with &quot;https://&quot;, this is simply unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, despite the HackerOne staff member saying I'd get access to earlier reports, this never came to be and the report was just marked as a duplicate. I honestly have not been following this too much since I started a new difficult college year and contractual work, but it's been patched at the time of writing this post since I tested the exploit 0n the 4th March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the outcome of this situation in my opinion is that HackerOne should train staff to understand MITM attacks and should also ensure that there is good communication with the company they are managing. Poor communication only serves to annoy people who may have just found serious vulnerabilities like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Valve's security email should be functional or not shown on their website. Not responding to a serious email to your security email address just shows a lack of concern which is extremely concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also need to add a huge thanks to Mohit Kumar from The Hacker News. He helped me validate my thoughts that this was not normal for a company. I'd never had to report a vulnerability before this, so I was very new to the process. If the vulnerability was still active, I would've gave you early notice that I was going to tweet this (although I never disclosed what the vulnerability actually was to him because of responsible disclosure) if it contained the vulnerability, but it was patched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Bloomberg's short-lived presidential bid reignited a long-simmering dispute over the widespread use of nondisclosure agreements at American corporations — especially at his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His namesake company, Bloomberg LP, has used nondisclosure agreements broadly to conceal allegations and silence complaints from employees of sexual harassment or a hostile work environment, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-built-a-toxic-sexually-charged-nightmare-for-women-2019-11&quot;&gt;published reports&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/michael-bloomberg-women/&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of one Bloomberg reporter and his wife showcases the widespread use of such legal restraints at the company — and how far their reach can extend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, Bloomberg News killed an investigation into the wealth of Communist Party elites in China, fearful of repercussions by the Chinese government. The company successfully silenced the reporters involved. And it sought to keep the spouse of one of the reporters quiet, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They assumed that because I was the wife of their employee, I was the wife,&quot; the author and journalist Leta Hong Fincher tells NPR. &quot;I was just an appendage of their employee. I was not a human being.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fincher is married to the journalist Mike Forsythe, a former Beijing correspondent for Bloomberg News who now works at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. In 2012, Forsythe was part of a Bloomberg team behind an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-29/xi-jinping-millionaire-relations-reveal-fortunes-of-elite&quot;&gt;award-winning investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the accumulation of wealth by China's ruling classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese ambassador warned Bloomberg executives against publishing the investigation. But Bloomberg News published the story anyway. Afterward, Forsythe received what he and Fincher considered death threats relayed through other journalists. He and Fincher moved their family to Hong Kong, believing it to be safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the reporting team pursued the next chapter, focusing on Chinese leaders' ties to the country's richest man, Wang Jianlin. Among those in the reporters' sights: the family of new Chinese President Xi Jinping. The story gained steam throughout 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In emails sent back to Bloomberg's journalists in China seen by Fincher, senior news editors in New York City expressed excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then: radio silence from headquarters. That story never ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mike and some of the other reporters and editors who had been working on this story just were asking for answers about ... why was this story killed?&quot; Fincher says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;edTag&quot;&gt;Winkler fears China will &quot;shut us down&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in late October 2013, Bloomberg's famously intense founding editor-in-chief, Matthew Winkler, weighed in, via a private conference call. In attendance: senior news executives in New York and the China-based investigative team. NPR has obtained audio of Winkler's remarks on the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is for sure going to, you know, invite the Communist Party to, you know, completely shut us down and kick us out of the country,&quot; Winkler said. &quot;So, I just don't see that as a story that is justified.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed great apprehension because of the potential consequences of publishing another investigation. In this case, it was one that would itemize the links between top Chinese Communist Party leaders and the country's wealthiest man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;audio-module-title&quot;&gt;Matthew Winkler: 'They will probably kick us out of the country.'&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winkler returned to those fears repeatedly. &quot;The inference is going to be interpreted by the government there as we are judging them,&quot; Winkler said. &quot;And they will probably kick us out of the country. They'll probably shut us down, is my guess.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winkler suggested reporters could find a uniquely &quot;Bloomberg&quot; way to cover the wealth of Chinese ruling elites. But he added a caution about covering the regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has to be done with a strategic framework and a tactical method that is ... smart enough to allow us to continue and not run afoul of the Nazis who are in front of us and behind us everywhere,&quot; Winkler said, according to the audio reviewed by NPR and verified by others. &quot;And that's who they are. And we should have no illusions about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, two Bloomberg editors told NPR the story didn't run because it needed additional reporting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/d121fd70-49f2-11e3-9a21-00144feabdc0&quot;&gt;Winkler publicly said much the same&lt;/a&gt;. But these audio recordings reveal otherwise. They also show how much newsroom leaders were worried about losing lucrative business in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first investigative project ran in 2012, the Chinese authorities had searched Bloomberg's news bureaus, delayed visas for reporters and ordered state-owned companies not to sign new leases for Bloomberg's primary product: its terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terminals are the lucrative basis of Mike Bloomberg's personal fortune — recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#2dc362161417&quot;&gt;estimated at more than $50 billion&lt;/a&gt;, making him one of the richest people in the world. Subscribers pay $20,000 annually for each terminal, which provides specialized financial data and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Bloomberg makes its money on terminals, it gains prestige and greater name recognition from its news division. Many of its stories, predominantly on business and finance, appear first on the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time the story was being pursued, China was seen as a growing market and a strategic priority, according to three former Bloomberg executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winkler alluded to that in his remarks. &quot;There's a way to use the information you have in such a way that enables us to report, but not kill ourselves in the process and wipe out everything we've tried to build there,&quot; he told the reporting team. Bloomberg News and Winkler declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;edTag&quot;&gt;Mayor Bloomberg and his newsroom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this debate played out inside Bloomberg News, Mike Bloomberg was the mayor of New York City. Officially, he had relinquished control of the company. In reality, his former executives say, Bloomberg was in frequent contact and shared his aspirations for growth in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a press conference after &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; first wrote about the internal fight over the decision not to publish, Bloomberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2013/11/bloomberg-on-bloomberg-news-china-reporting-nobody-thinks-we-are-wusses-000000&quot;&gt;denied the story had been killed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nobody thinks we are wusses and not willing to stand up and write stories that are of interest to the public and that are factually correct,&quot; Bloomberg said at a City Hall press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after those remarks, Bloomberg's term as mayor ended and he returned to the company he founded. In January 2014, Bloomberg held a town hall for his global newsroom. NPR also obtained portions of that audio. Asked about the China controversy, Bloomberg sounded a new note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;article id=&quot;res833738486&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap resaudio secondary insecure&quot; aria-label=&quot;audio-module&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;audio-module&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;audio-module-title&quot;&gt;Michael Bloomberg: 'You have two choices.'&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If a country gives you the license to do something with certain restrictions, you have two choices,&quot; Bloomberg told his staff. &quot;You either accept the license and do it that way, or you don't do business there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg said the newsroom should be proud of its coverage of China. He also said there were a few &quot;bad apples&quot; at any large institution. Some journalists at Bloomberg News took that to be aimed at the China team. Through a corporate spokesman, Bloomberg LP and its founder, the former mayor, declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following month, Bloomberg LP Board Chairman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/transcripts/294385257?storyld=294385257?storyld=294385257&quot;&gt;Peter Grauer told the Asia Society's Hong Kong chapter&lt;/a&gt; that the company had about 50 journalists in China primarily to write about the local business and economic environment there. &quot;Every once in a while, we wander a little bit away from that and write stories that we probably ... should have rethought,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2013, Bloomberg News suspended Forsythe, accusing him of leaking word of the controversy to other news outlets. The company would later fire him. He soon landed at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forsythe declined to comment for this story. In leaving the company, he signed a nondisclosure agreement that bars him from speaking publicly about his time at Bloomberg News. Others from the China investigative team would leave the company in the years that followed, each having first signed an agreement not to disparage the company. In at least one case, a journalist signed the nondisparagement deal in part to prevent the loss of a month's pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Bloomberg News pressured someone else to sign a nondisclosure agreement: Forsythe's wife, Fincher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They threatened to force Forsythe and Fincher to pay back the tens of thousands of dollars spent to move their family to Hong Kong after the death threats. Bloomberg also threatened to sue to make the couple pay the company's legal costs, pushing the dollar amount well into the six figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was no reason why I should have to sign a nondisclosure agreement,&quot; Fincher tells NPR, &quot;because I didn't possess any damaging material about the company.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to the general counsel of a rival media company, a top executive who has overseen contracts at two major television networks, and also a leading workplace attorney to determine whether they had ever heard of a company demanding a nondisclosure agreement from the spouse of an employee. Each separately said they had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fincher recalls being summoned to the high-rise offices of Bloomberg's Hong Kong legal team. Her husband was there too, with his own lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recalls staring at a giant projection of Bloomberg's outside lawyer from New York City on a video screen. He rejected her assurances that she did not pose any threat, demanding a formal nondisclosure agreement by asking, &quot;What about all the evidence that's in her head?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fincher is a former correspondent for CNBC and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.voanews.com/author/leta-hong-fincher&quot;&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, she was finishing up her doctorate at a Chinese university. She bristled at what the company's lawyers were suggesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They assumed that my husband would be able to silence me,&quot; Fincher says. &quot;He didn't want to do that. That's not the kind of relationship that we have.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fincher tells NPR she walked out of the conference room, took the elevator to the lobby, left the building and never returned. Bloomberg LP continued to press her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/business/michael-bloomberg-nda.html&quot;&gt;a Bloomberg corporate spokeswoman told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that Forsythe stole &quot;Bloomberg L.P. intellectual property and gave it to his wife.&quot; The spokeswoman, Natalie Harland, said that Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg News never pressured anyone to sign a nondisclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal documents reviewed by NPR contradict that claim, showing Bloomberg LP's muscular efforts to obtain a nondisclosure contract from Fincher. In letters to Fincher's Hong Kong lawyers, Bloomberg LP's attorneys insisted that she sign an agreement that includes, among other items, a promise she would never criticize the company or its officers. Bloomberg's lawyers also explicitly stated they reserved the right to sue her in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fincher ultimately ended up hiring a pair of elite Hong Kong lawyers who had previously represented a famous American whistleblower: Edward Snowden. And Bloomberg LP relented and let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a year later, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/world/asia/wang-jianlin-abillionaire-at-the-intersection-of-business-and-power-in-china.html&quot;&gt;Times would publish Forsythe's expose&lt;/a&gt; about billionaire Wang Jianlin and the close relatives of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Several people who know Forsythe, including Fincher, say it took that long to publish because he had to painstakingly re-report the elements of the story he had previously documented with the Bloomberg team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2020/02/18/mike-bloomberg-lp-nda-china/&quot;&gt;Fincher wrote about the incident&lt;/a&gt; recently for &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;, spurred by Mike &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bloomberg-faces-attacks-for-refusing-to-release-women-from-confidentiality-agreements/2020/02/20/4b3c8b52-532e-11ea-929a-64efa7482a77_story.html&quot;&gt;Bloomberg's exchange with Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; over nondisclosure agreements at Bloomberg LP at a Democratic debate in February. (Fincher was a supporter of Warren's presidential bid.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg's brief candidacy never really recovered. He pledged to release three women who complained about his own conduct at the company from contractual requirements that they not speak publicly, though some laid-off staffers from his campaign have told reporters they, too, were forced to sign nondisclosure agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fincher asks her own lingering question: What else at Bloomberg News is being hidden if such contracts exist that require such secrecy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;leading-loose mt-0 z-10 relative text-gray-800&quot;&gt;I needed a solution that cut across silos and gave our developers a tool they could use themselves to provision infrastructure to suit their own immediate needs. The way Pulumi solves the multi-cloud problem is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;leading-loose mt-0 z-10 relative text-gray-800&quot;&gt;As the largest eCommerce platform in Latin America, our infrastructure has to be highly stable, well documented and agile. With Pulumi, we're able to develop new infrastructure, change existing infrastructure and more with greater speed and reliability than we've ever had before.&lt;/p&gt;
