<title>Farewell, Google Maps</title>
<link>https://www.inderapotheke.de/blog/farewell-google-maps</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.inderapotheke.de/blog/farewell-google-maps</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google decided to make Maps its next billion dollar business by raising prices 14 times and decreasing free usage limit almost 30 times, all with minimal notice period. Fortunately, the move energised map competitors. Apple Maps, Mapbox, TomTom - which alternative is best for mid- and larger sites?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(this is an English version of the article based on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gdziepolek.pl/blog/pozegnanie-z-google-maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GdziePoLek.pl&lt;/a&gt; site in Poland)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our startup allows patients to find medicines they need in brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Even from the name (&quot;&lt;span&gt;where I get my meds&lt;/span&gt;&quot; in English) you could tell that &lt;span&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; is an important part of it. It is easy to explain how the service works through a single picture, and Google Maps has always been a prominent background of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Typical web page for our service: showing availability of the product&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps-intro.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we always knew that as we grew larger, there would be cost to using Google Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up till now, free usage limit of about 750 thousand map loads per month was well aligned with scale when one can expect to generate revenues that cover the cost. Price for commercial usage ($0.5 for 1000 map loads) was not high enough to consider alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, however, we got an email as a &quot;high usage&quot; client of Google Maps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Email from Google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps-email.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a conference call with Google Maps customer service (who, contrary to the email, offered no discounts or credits whatsoever) we realised that price increases are huge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current free usage limit of &lt;span&gt;750k&lt;/span&gt; requests monthly turns into ca. &lt;span&gt;28k&lt;/span&gt; requests (almost 30 times less)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current &lt;span&gt;$0.5&lt;/span&gt; for commercial usage becomes &lt;span&gt;$7&lt;/span&gt; (14 times more), $5.60 with high volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, prices are the same from US to the Africa, despite the fact that revenue generation is vastly different in most developed countries compared to the others. We know it well from comparing Polish market to Germany, as we expand there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Comparison of Google Maps monthly bill before and after price hike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps-monthly-cost-en.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we maintained current monthly usage of both maps and Places (ie. location search), the cost of Google Maps would be multiple times higher than the total cost of all other infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comparing visuals and level of detail &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Maps is objectively the best product on its market, in many regards positioned light years ahead of its competitors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Excellent analysis&lt;/a&gt; of how advanced are Google's maps compared to the others was published by Justin O’Beirne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that even though maps are such an important part of our user interface, they serve no more advanced purpose than effectively visualising locations of pharmacies. Therefore we do not use advanced functions which are most likely to have proprietary APIs, such as satellite images, routes calculation and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important is visual quality of the maps and level of detail that they provide in the territory where we operate, which is mostly Poland and, hopefully soon, Germany. Below comparison of how the same location in the centre of Warsaw looks like with different map providers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Same pharmacy in Warsaw on various maps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps_warsaw_zv0dox.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Where it was possible we overlayed our custom markers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first glance, it seems that almost all providers would provide satisfactory experience as far as centre of Warsaw is concerned. One exception might be Azure Maps, which was made available just in the previous months. To be fair, Microsoft claims that perceived emptiness of its maps is intentional and for the benefit of its large corporate partners, who like to overlay a large amount of their own information on the maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps centre of Warsaw might not be representative of the whole country, however, and map quality for smaller cities might be worse. Therefore we also compared views in the smaller town (Konstancin):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Pharmacy in vicinity Konstancin-Jeziorna&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps_konstancin_od0pyx.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite our initial concerns, it turned out that we are not hostage to Google Maps after all and many alternatives look surprisingly decent in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Added:&lt;/span&gt; often there is an opportunity to create a custom map style, which we didn't explore as we don't use custom maps on our site. But it's clearly an important thing for Mapbox, where mentions of various editors confused us slightly at pricing (below), and MapTiler (customisation tutorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maptiler.com/how-to/make-own-map-design/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comparing prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map providers use different pricing models, which makes direct comparison of prices difficult. Here is an overview of the options for paid usage (not taking into account free usage allowance):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google Maps&lt;/span&gt; - $7 for each 1000 map loads irrespective of map size or zooming/panning by the user ($5.60 with discount for high volume)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mapbox&lt;/span&gt; - $0.50 for each &quot;map view&quot;, which despite the name is not a map view, but request of 4 or 15 map tiles (depending on map type), rounded up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Azure Maps&lt;/span&gt; - $0.50 for 1000 &quot;transactions&quot;, where transaction is equal to 15 map tiles &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;TomTom&lt;/span&gt; - $0.50 for 1000 “transactions” ($0.40 with highest volume discounts), each transaction is equal to 15 map tiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;HERE&lt;/span&gt; - pricing is by bundles, Standard bundle amounts to  $0.50 for 1000 “transactions” (15 tiles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;MapTiler&lt;/span&gt; - $0.05 for each map tile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple Maps&lt;/span&gt; - so far is in beta and offers a generous free usage allowance, no commercial pricing available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find Google model most transparent (leaving aside the price), because every web site page view with a map on it will have the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of paying by each map tile, as with MapTiler, things are getting more complicated. How many tiles are present on each map depends on its size, which in case of responsive sites might be different for each user depending on the screen resolution. Apart from that, user might move map around or zoom, drawing further tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least transparent we found the pricing terms of Mapbox. Not only it's unclear how many tiles are calculated for each &quot;map view&quot;, the term itself is misleading (other companies use &quot;transaction&quot;, which doesn't imply that it's a full cost for map view like with Google Maps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From looking at pricing terms it's hard to reason what would be the actual daily cost for the whole site. Our startup, for example, uses both small maps on pharmacies' profiles, as well as huge full-screen maps presenting search results - but only for desktop users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short list of alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which maps should we investigate deeper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some options we could reject quickly for various reasons. &lt;span&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/span&gt; is not supposed to be directly used by commercial sites. &lt;span&gt;Apple Maps&lt;/span&gt;, even though we wouldn't mind having Apple logo on our site somewhere, was just released as beta and requires Apple developer account to test properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would love to be able to use &lt;span&gt;Azure Maps&lt;/span&gt; along with other services that we are already using on Azure. However, proprietary Javascript API leaves much to be desired, even when one tries to implement the simplest use cases (eg. custom markers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HERE&lt;/span&gt; maps seem a poor match visually for our site (too stark), have proprietary interface and we prefer pay-as-you-go billing to bundles. But a large site that we know decided to migrate to HERE, so we will see how it works for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find the most attractive option to be using one common, open source javascript library - like &lt;span&gt;Leaflet&lt;/span&gt; - allowing seamless changes of underlying providers of the actual map tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such opportunity can be had if we went with &lt;span&gt;Mapbox&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span&gt;MapTiler&lt;/span&gt;, and perhaps TomTom, which, however, uses a slightly modified Leaflet client and requires pre-paid billing instead of pay-as-you-go which we prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comparing actual daily cost for our site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We upgraded our web application in order to be able to switch map provider by a single click in the administration console. Then we watched amount of resources that we consumed daily in case of each short-listed map provider, ie. Google Maps, Mapbox and MapTiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Comparing the actual cost for maps on a single day (15,000 total site visits, of which not all might involve maps) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps-daily-cost-en.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Comparison is specific to GdziePoLek.pl and its usage of maps across the site, as well as screen sizes of its users, resulting in maps of different sizes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Maps would have most favorable model for users of big and intensively interacted with maps, like us, but radical price increase puts the cost way higher than alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned, cost of using Mapbox and MapTiler in our case is comparable, despite slightly different billing model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapbox has more resources to its disposal - 400 employees according to LinkedIn, compared to MapTiler's 7 team members - thanks to Softbank's $164m investment. On the other hand, having acquired that much capital, the company is branching out in several directions (autonomous driving, VR...) which for a user dependent on its maps service might be somehow concerning. Therefore we will keep using both services in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not for radical price hike, we would not embark upon looking for Google Maps replacement, as it would be clearly a &quot;not broken - don't repair it&quot; situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudden change of policy by Google, which is directed specifically at startups (as smaller web sites should largely remain below even the new lower thresholds), is surely an unpleasant surprise for us and does not create much trust in Google as a vendor. In the future we would therefore keep our distance from &lt;span&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/span&gt; and avoid deep integration with any Google services on which it can pull a similar trick. For example we would be wary on taking free &lt;span&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/span&gt; for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note we were impressed by the quality of open source code for operating maps (Leaflet). Some advanced functions which we had implement ourselves on Google side were readily available in Leaflet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people starting development of a startup making heavy use of maps, we would recommend using Leaflet and independent map vendors and avoiding dependence on Google.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fukushima’s nuclear signature found in California wine</title>
<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611654/fukushimas-nuclear-signature-found-in-california-wine/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611654/fukushimas-nuclear-signature-found-in-california-wine/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1950s, the US, the Soviet Union, and others tested thermonuclear weapons in the Earth’s atmosphere. Those tests released vast quantities of radioactive material into the air and triggered fears that the nuclear reactions could ignite deuterium in the oceans, thereby destroying the planet in a catastrophic accidental fireball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;l-automated-trending--ordered&quot; data-widget-type=&quot;automated-trending&quot; data-widget-layout=&quot;ordered&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;automated-trending__h&quot;&gt;Recommended for You&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric tests ended in 1980, when China finished its program, but the process has left a long-lasting nuclear signature on the planet. One of the most obvious signatures is cesium-137, a radioactive by-product of the fission of uranium-235.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After release into the atmosphere, cesium-137 was swept around the world and found its way into the food supply in trace quantities. Such an addition is rarely welcomed. But in 2001, the French pharmacologist Philippe Hubert discovered that he could use this signature to date wines without opening the bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-img article-img--text-col&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/cesium-137-in-wine.jpg?sw=600&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=1179&amp;amp;ch=478&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/cesium-137-in-wine.jpg?sw=600&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=1179&amp;amp;ch=478 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/cesium-137-in-wine.jpg?sw=1200&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=1179&amp;amp;ch=478 2x&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique immediately became a useful weapon in the fight against wine fraud—labeling young wines as older vintages to inflate their price. Such fraud can be spotted by various types of chemical and isotope analysis—but only after the wine has been opened, which destroys its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cesium-137, on the other hand, allows noninvasive testing because it is radioactive. It produces distinctive gamma rays in proportion to the amount of isotope present. Dating the wine is a simple process of matching the amount of cesium-137 to atmospheric records from the time the wine was made. That quickly reveals any fraud. Indeed, if there is no cesium-137, the wine must date from after 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one blip in this record, though. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 bathed much of Europe, and other parts of the world, in a radioactive cloud that increased atmospheric levels of cesium-137 again. Hubert and colleagues can see this blip in their data from wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that raises an interesting question about the Fukushima disaster of 2011, an accident of Chernobyl proportions caused by a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan following a huge earthquake and tsunami. It released a radioactive cloud that bathed North America in fissile by-products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to see the effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in California wines produced at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we get an answer, thanks to a study carried out by Hubert and a couple of colleagues. “In January 2017, we came across a series of Californian wines (Cabernet Sauvignon) from vintage 2009 to 2012,” say Hubert and company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of wines provides the perfect test. The Fukushima disaster occurred on March 11, 2011. Any wine made before that date should be free of the effects, while any dating from afterward could show them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team began their study with the conventional measurement of cesium-137 levels in the unopened bottles. That showed levels to be indistinguishable from background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the team was able to carry out more-sensitive tests by opening the wine and reducing it to ash by evaporation. This involves heating the wine to 100 degrees Celsius for one hour and then increasing the temperature to 500 degrees Celsius for eight hours. In this way, a standard 750-milliliter bottle of wine produces around four grams of ashes. The ashes were then placed in a gamma ray detector to look for signs of cesium-137.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this method, Hubert and his colleagues found measurable amounts of cesium-137 above background levels in the wine produced after 2011. “It seems there is an increase in activity in 2011 by a factor of two,” conclude the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That probably won’t be very useful for fraud detection in California wine—the levels of cesium-137 are barely detectable, and even then, only if the wine is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the result does show how nuclear disasters can have unexpected consequences long after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>San Francisco&amp;#039;s zoning makes it illegal to build apartments in 73.5% of the city</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt; means single-family or duplexes only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orange&lt;/strong&gt; means triplexes or fourplexes are legal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt; means larger apartment buildings are legal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;23.738317757009&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Apartment building&quot; is defined to be a building with 3 or more homes. It is illegal to build a building with more than 5 homes in 87% of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,500 sq ft is a typical lot size in San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumes 2.5 apartments per 10 ft of height per 2,500 sq ft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculations include &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf-planning.org/accessory-dwelling-units&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;waiverless ADUs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many apartment buildings already exist in the red and orange areas but would be illegal to build today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see why new development is concentrated in the Mission, Soma, and Tenderloin neighborhoods&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Java type system is broken</title>
<link>http://wouter.coekaerts.be/2018/java-type-system-broken</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://wouter.coekaerts.be/2018/java-type-system-broken</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of a programming language’s type system is to provide guarantees about what types can be encountered at certain points in your program; to document the values we expect to see in a way that the compiler can verify. But Java’s type system has holes, the guarantees can be broken. Some of these holes are deliberate, mostly for backward compatibility. For example using raw types or unchecked casts you can cause &lt;em&gt;heap pollution&lt;/em&gt;. Heap pollution means that the content of a parameterized type does not match its type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; stringList = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
List list = stringList;
// compiler warning: unchecked call to add(E) as a member of the raw type java.util.List
list.add(1);
// throws java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String
String s = stringList.get(0);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These come with compiler warnings, so you know you’re leaving the safety of the type system when you use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story of what I found looking for constructs that the compiler and/or specification claim are safe, do not generate warnings, but cause heap pollution, leading to a ClassCastException where there is no explicit cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples here were tested with JDK 10, but most of them work (sometimes with small changes) in older versions too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About wildcards and capture conversion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a quick introduction into my mental model of wildcards and capture conversion. Take a variable defined as &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. You can assign &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;s of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; type to it, but when you take its value, you have a List of &lt;em&gt;a concrete unknown&lt;/em&gt; type. The expression &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has as type the &lt;em&gt;capture conversion&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is a non-denotable type: a type that cannot be expressed in the Java language, but is commonly written as &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Capture conversion replaces every top-level type argument that is a wildcard with a capture of that wildcard; e.g. the capture conversion of &lt;code&gt;Map&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;, ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Map&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;, capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help understand the difference between a wildcard and a captured type: a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a List to which you can add any other type of List; it can e.g. contain a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; contains Lists of an unknown type, and all those Lists have the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; unknown type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capture conversion is applied by the compiler to the type of every expression, and produces a unique type every time it is applied. That leads to counter-intuitive restrictions such as adding an element of a list in the same list (&lt;code&gt;a.add(a.get(0))&lt;/code&gt;) not being considered type-safe. The &lt;code&gt;capture of ?&lt;/code&gt; in the type of the first &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as the second &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. That makes sense if you consider that the value of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; might have changed between the &lt;code&gt;a.get&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;a.add&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A capture type represents the specific type for a wildcard in a &lt;em&gt;single execution&lt;/em&gt; of a single expression. But an expression in a program only has one type, and can be executed multiple times, e.g in a for-loop. So how can that type represent only a single execution? The trick is that capture types only exist in the scope of a single expression; their scope is so narrow that within that scope the expression can only be executed once. A capture type cannot escape outside the body of the for-loop in which it is created, because that would require having a variable of the capture type, and there isn’t any way to express such a variable in the Java syntax.&lt;br /&gt;Or can it?…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lambda expressions are broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For capture types to represent the type of a single execution of an expression, the assumption is made that within an expression (the scope of the capture type) every sub-expression (that can reference the capture type) is only executed once. That assumption might have been correct when this was introduced in Java 5, but not anymore. A lambda expression is a sub-expression that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be evaluated multiple times within the same expression. That’s quite a fundamental problem. To make this sound important we could say &lt;em&gt;lambdas make Java’s type system unsound&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Take this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; stringList = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
Stream.of(stringList, Arrays.asList(1))
    .map(list -&amp;gt; list)
    .reduce((list1, list2) -&amp;gt; {list1.addAll(list2); return list1;});
String v = stringList.get(0); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, different instances of a wildcard type are squeezed through the same captured type, and then made to interact with each other. The &lt;code&gt;Stream.of&lt;/code&gt; creates a &lt;code&gt;Stream&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a stream of lists each of an unknown type. Then in the seemingly redundant map step that &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type is capture converted to &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That incorrectly turns it into a &lt;code&gt;Stream&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, meaning a stream of lists all of the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; type. The reduce step then abuses that to move elements from the &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, breaking the type system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local inner classes are broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lambdas problem got me thinking: Are there other kinds of types that are only visible in a limited scope, for a single execution, but could creep out of that scope? Well, local inner classes (classes declared inside of a method) have limited scope. And if it is a generic method, then we also get a type variable that’s assumed to only represent a type for one execution of that method. A problem exploiting that is that you can only have one execution of the method &lt;em&gt;in scope&lt;/em&gt; at a time, and if it moves out of scope we lose the type information. But unlike capture types these types have names, so we can restore the type information with a cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Object prev;
&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; T go(T t) {
  class A extends ArrayList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { }
  if (prev == null) { // first execution
    A a = new A();
    a.add(t);
    prev = a;
    return null;
  } else { // second execution
    return ((A) prev).get(0);
  }
}

go(1);
String s = go(&quot;&quot;); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can argue it’s the cast in there is what indirectly leads to the ClassCastException. But note that checked (not unchecked) casts are supposed to be safe: they should either succeed when the runtime value has the right type, or fail immediately. Checked casts causing heap pollution are a type system loophole. Just in case you’re not convinced, we can do this without an explicit cast, by instead throwing the value straight from one invocation of the method into another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; T go(T in, Object other) {
  class A extends RuntimeException {
    T t;
  }
  if (other != null) { // first execution
    try {
      go(other, null);
    } catch (A a) {
      return a.t; // returns other
    }
    throw new AssertionError(); // unreachable
  } else {
    A a = new A();
    a.t = in;
    throw a;
  }
}

String s = go(&quot;&quot;, 1); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that inner classes nested in generic classes, on the other hand, are treated like generic types. That means casts to them are unchecked, and they cannot extend Throwable. It’s an oversight that the same wasn’t done for local classes in generic methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inner classes in generic classes are broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another problem with anonymous inner classes extending inner classes nested in generic classes when the outer instance has a wildcard in its type. Whew, that’s a mouthful. It creates a class whose supertype has a capture type as type parameter. That’s as if you could write &lt;code&gt;class MyList extends ArrayList&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That’s just nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
// generic class with inner class
class Box&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; {
  A a;
  Box(A a) { this.a = a; }
  class Inner {
    void setA(A newA) { a = newA; }
    A getA() { return a; }
  }
}

Object prev;
Box&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; stringBox = new Box&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(&quot;1&quot;);
// box is the outer instance, with a wildcard type
for (Box&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; box : List.of(stringBox, new Box&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(1))) {
  // the anonymous inner class, with the weird supertype
  box.new Inner() {{
    if (prev == null) prev = this;
    else this.getClass().cast(prev).setA(this.getA());
  }};
}

String s = stringBox.a; // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more problems with such a class: the class file format has no way to properly represent its generic type signature. If we try to access that type using &lt;code&gt;((Box&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;)stringBox).new Inner(){}.getClass().getGenericSuperclass()&lt;/code&gt;, we get a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.reflect.GenericSignatureFormatError&lt;/code&gt;. The type system just isn’t equipped to deal with this construct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Type variable bound checking is broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since generics were introduced, there have been problems with where exactly capture conversion should be applied. The situation has definitely improved since Java 5, but it didn’t take long for me to stumble upon this problem still persisting in Java 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a class defined as &lt;code&gt;class Grid&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; extends ArrayList&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you naively fill in the type variable &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; with the type argument, then it looks like a &lt;code&gt;Grid&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. But that’s not right: in a &lt;code&gt;Grid&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; every cell has the same type, while in a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; different rows can have different types of cells. Capture conversion is supposed to solve that problem. But outside of expressions, for example in the bounds on type variables, it’s not applied consistently. So Java allows us to define this inconsistent class hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
class Grid&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; extends ArrayList&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {}
class Wrapper&amp;lt;T extends List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; extends ArrayList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {}
// the definition of this class should not have been legal
class GridWrapper&amp;lt;T extends Grid&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt; extends Wrapper&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {}

GridWrapper&amp;lt;Grid&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gridWrapper = new GridWrapper&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
gridWrapper.add(new Grid&amp;lt;&amp;gt;());
Wrapper&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; wrapper = gridWrapper;
wrapper.get(0).add(List.of(1));
String s = gridWrapper.get(0).get(0).get(0); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outer type variables as bound of inner classes are broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some background on bounds of capture types. When capture conversion creates a capture type out of a wildcard, it includes the bounds on the type variable also as a bound (supertype) of that capture type. For example, if you’d declare a &lt;code&gt;class Foo&amp;lt;T extends Number&amp;gt; {}&lt;/code&gt;, then the capture conversion of &lt;code&gt;Foo&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Foo&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where that capture has &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; as bound. The bound of the capture type is not always the same as the bound on the type variable. For example in &lt;code&gt;class Bar&amp;lt;T, S extends T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; the capture type for the wildcard in &lt;code&gt;Bar&amp;lt;String, ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not have &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; as bound, but is replaced with its value, &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes wrong when the bound on a type variable refers to a type variable of an outer class. Then the type variable replacement doesn’t seem to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
class Outer&amp;lt;P&amp;gt; {
  class MyList&amp;lt;I extends P&amp;gt; extends ArrayList&amp;lt;I&amp;gt; {
    MyList(I i) {add(i);}
  }
  P getIt(Outer&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;.MyList&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; myList) {
    return myList.get(0); // this should not be valid
  }
}
// ClassCastException
String s = new Outer&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;().getIt(
    new Outer&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;().new MyList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;(1));
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example &lt;code&gt;myList&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;MyList&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; is an upper bound of that capture. That’s a different &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; than the one that happens to be in scope there, causing the mixup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honorable mention 1: Unboxing in lambdas is broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for constructs that throw unexpected ClassCastExceptions lead me to this weird one. This does not qualify as a type system loophole, but &lt;em&gt;oh compiler, what were you thinking?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
List.of('x', 'y').stream()
  .max((a, b) -&amp;gt; {return List.of(a).get(0);});
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lambda expression given to max is a Comparator, which is supposed to return an int. In this example it indirectly returns a Character, which is supposed to be unboxed to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; and then converted to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. Something goes wrong in there, leading to a &lt;code&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt; for casting a &lt;code&gt;Character&lt;/code&gt; to an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honorable mention 2: TreeSet is broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the type system that has problems, the standard library isn’t entirely type-safe either. Today’s shortest participant in our show of unexpected ClassCastExceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
new TreeSet&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(){{add(1);add(&quot;&quot;);}};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one is disqualified as a flaw because the &lt;code&gt;TreeSet.add&lt;/code&gt; javadoc specifically says that it “throws ClassCastException if the specified object cannot be compared with the elements currently in this set”. But the implementation of that relies on an unchecked cast that can lead to heap pollution elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; stringList = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
TreeSet&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; set = new TreeSet&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(
  (a, b) -&amp;gt; {b.addAll(a); return 0;});
set.add(stringList);
set.remove(List.of(0));
String s = stringList.get(0); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s always been broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling around (after I wrote the above) shows me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8170887&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bugs.openjdk.java.net']);&quot;&gt;Capture variables should not escape lambda bodies&lt;/a&gt; was known since 2016 (but with a more complicated setup). And &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8164401&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bugs.openjdk.java.net']);&quot;&gt;incorrect treatment of wildcards in subtyping&lt;/a&gt; looks pretty similar to my type variable bound checking problem. And maybe some of the other problems here aren’t new either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about known problems, I must also mention the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/java-is-unsound-28c84cb2b3f&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://hackernoon.com']);&quot;&gt;“Java is Unsound” post&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2984004&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://dl.acm.org']);&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;). That was a great find, interesting read. But I have a different view on these things: None of this comes close to impacting security. And that’s not just by luck. Heap pollution was a deliberate compromise in the type system. Java’s generics have always been known to be too fragile to fully trust. Many problems in it have been popping up ever since it was introduced (and most of those were fixed over time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh no, what do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Java type system is full of loopholes. Some are deliberate, some are accidental. The difference is that some generate compiler warnings, and some do not. The kind of compiler warnings that most programmers ignore or suppress, without giving it much thought. In practice any sufficiently large Java program makes use of the deliberate loopholes in unsafe ways; because it’s the most practical thing to do. That includes the Java collections library. It’s unlikely you’ll run into the accidental loopholes of this post by accident. That doesn’t mean we should throw our hands in the air and stop trying to make it better. Java’s type system has taken a beating by the desire for backward compatibility and the interaction of its growing list of features. It needs some love to get it back in shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is broken. Everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Opened new JDK bugs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8203335&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bugs.openjdk.java.net']);&quot;&gt;JDK-8203335&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8203337&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bugs.openjdk.java.net']);&quot;&gt;JDK-8203337&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8203338&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bugs.openjdk.java.net']);&quot;&gt;JDK-8203338&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8203340&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bugs.openjdk.java.net']);&quot;&gt;JDK-8203340&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Simone Giertz – Back from brain surgery [video]</title>
<link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-INz4XVeyJ4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-INz4XVeyJ4</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I had a brain tumor. Then I had some brain surgery. Then I made a video about it. I've missed you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being here, and for all of your nice messages, terrible jokes and care packages. It's been an onslaught of love unlike anything I could ever have imagined.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;33.925601750547&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;GraphQL is great for the frontend, but moving to GraphQL involves both people and tech issues. Common mistakes made when using new technologies are made all over again.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Watch out for bad implementation of the GraphQL API (this will definitely result in bad performance).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Design the GraphQL schema that you want the user to see/perceive. Not every object or field in your database needs to be exposed via the API the way it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My workplace is currently moving a huge monolith into a bunch of manageable components. Each of these components has its own GraphQL endpoint. Using schema-stitching, these are being stitched together into one endpoint for API users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;As a result of our codebase, we've tried GraphQL in:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Ruby (graphql-ruby) - WATCHOUT Relay arguments for connection fields are not exposed to the library user. So basically you have to implement your own Relay-compliant stuff if you need access to the pagination arguments from Relay. Also, documentation is broken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Python (graphene) - We've had no issues so far. We worked around it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Node.js (Apollo GraphQL) - OH MY BUTTERFLIES. So far, this is the ONLY library I have come across that is polished and has plenty of documentation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Elixir (Absinthe) - My coworker worked on this part. He did not complain. So I'm assuming he had no issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The &quot;Learn * in a day&quot; joke applies to GraphQL. As simple as GraphQL looks for the client-side, it is beast of a job to build a GraphQL backend that is optimized for production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Servers-side implementation of GraphQL is not very well documented apart from hello-worldly examples. Most of the knowledge found online is about client-side usage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Due to poor documentation/examples provided, ramping up people with GraphQL is hard. Most first iterations I've had to review were slower than our REST APIs because of unoptimized code. Sitting down for a few minutes solves that problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;To ramp up people at work place, I ended up having to do this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Ask people to use the GitHub v4 API to checkout GraphQL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Make them build a GraphQL server for a blog app.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Dive straight into whatever feature/API they would build.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Review their work a few dozen times and show them optimization tricks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;My most valuable lesson: When in doubt, dig into the source of these libraries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;37.942667471334&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So far so good, especially on the front-end. We love the queries, the caching downside don't bother us &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;, but mutations make me a little nervous (conceptually, ecumenically, grammatically...).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;On the server side, it is a mixed bag. Defining a new type system on top of our existing one, and on top of the Avro schemas we have for inter-service communication, it feels... a bit much. Each layer has a purpose so I can't advocate for removal, but it does feel silly at times. Also the documentation on pagination feels incomplete to the point of confusion, and depending on how you search for answers, you might find blog posts that add confusion rather than clarity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Some additional friction came from the specific version of the Ruby server library we jumped in at. They went &lt;em&gt;a little overboard&lt;/em&gt; in the amount of metaprogramming used by the DSL, and I say that as someone who enjoys metaprogramming shenanigans for fun on a Friday night! But it took a long time to understand why adding some custom behavior, in a way that seemed utterly necessary, was not possible (e.g. defining methods inside the DSL's type block did not class_exec them into existence on the resulting class in any reasonable way). They have since released a new version whose main API is class-based, which is much more clear, enables everything I desire, and I am eagerly awaiting next month when we get to upgrade to that and refactor. Thanks to the maintainers for recognizing this was needed, and for doing the heavy lifting to pull it off!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;What I enjoy about GraphQL conceptually is that it dodges a certain square-peg-round-hole issue I occasionally saw with REST, but in the same way that leaves me nervous that we'll end up back at a land of inconsistent RPC spaghetti. In an API where an iron-fisted &quot;RESTful Actions Only!&quot; rule is enforced, many domains find &lt;em&gt;just those one or two actions&lt;/em&gt; that feel like they are a better fit for their own unique verb, a custom-named action. The rhetorical-and-ontological escape hatch for REST's limited verb set is to have an abstract &quot;resource&quot; that only has, say, a POST option. You can only &quot;create&quot; an &quot;/recalculate_contacts&quot; resource, but never GET, DELETE and so forth. Or you PUT to &quot;/contacts/recalculate&quot;, or some other silliness that just feels too clever by half.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Those of us who were scarred by inconsistent, poorly-thought-out RPC spaghetti over the years cling to REST because it brought peace to our nightmares via simple rules that &lt;em&gt;almost fit&lt;/em&gt; everything, and as a bonus, really gel with HTTP semantics. Because GraphQL's Mutations really don't specify much of anything, I immediately assumed it would descend into a sort of API moral decadence, but that has not borne out so far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If anything, I am heartened to see that newer (though not necessarily younger!) developers, who grew up in a world where REST was all they knew, do not have this temptation to go off the deep end with action names, or to craft RPC-esque systems with ill-considered boundaries of behavior. For the most part they want to name things ala REST, because that's what they are used to, except once in a while. So that is what our company goes with in terms of mutations: Wherever possible, name it for the CRUD action it represents. Only use a more unique/one-off verb if it is truly justified. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

If you've ever used apollo-cache-persist[1] or graphql-crunch[2], we authored those libraries. Our startup, if you're curious, is a social podcasting app written in react-native (&lt;a href=&quot;https://banter.fm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://banter.fm&lt;/a&gt;). We learned &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of GraphQL lessons building it.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The tl;dr; is that graphql gives you a lot of flexibility and typed schemas are nice, but it doesn't come for free and I miss the tooling around http.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Pros:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Typed schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Custom queries retrieve all the data the client needs in one request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Really easy to implement, both server-side and client-side&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Server-side, it's trivial to have any field resolved in any way you want (redis, memcache, postgres, some random service)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Easy and arbitrary mutations. There's no pontificating over what verbs are the proper ones to us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- If you use react, the community and ecosystem often assumes you're using GraphQL, so it may make sense to use graphql just so you don't swim against the current.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Cons:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- The payloads can quickly become huge because there is often a ton of duplication in a responses (depending on your query patterns). See this example on the SWAPI demo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2uOFZBP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://bit.ly/2uOFZBP&lt;/a&gt;. The result is 1MB of JSON, ~97% of which is data that exists somewhere else in the response already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Refactoring types is often impossible to do in a backwards-compatible way, even if the shape of the data is the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- You don't know what data you'll need in advance, so you're basically doing all of your joins by going back and forth between the api resolver and your data sources (this can be alleviated with persistent queries, but those come with their own set of issues). A typical query to hydrate a response for a user's feed in our app requests ~1,100 objects. After caching and consolidating queries into multi-gets, it translates to about 50 distinct DB queries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Tooling: Working at the HTTP level simply has better tooling and tons of infrastructure around caching and serving content (varnish, nginx, etc...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;We found that graphql payloads were so large that older mobile phones were spending significant time parsing them. We created graphql-crunch to de-duplicate responses before sending them over the wire. This led to nice perf improvements on mobile platforms. It also gave us referential equality when persisting the results to cache, allowing us to reduce a lot of work client side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you're going to use GraphQL, embrace the javascript ecosystem. Also use Apollo[3]. Also use DataLoader[4]. Roughly 40% of our queries get resolved for &quot;free&quot; by data loader.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If I were to do it again, I'd at least prototype a REST-api with resources designed specifically for http cache-ability (that is, break out session-specific resources/attributes vs shared resources) and see if HTTP/2 multiplexing + nginx caching + etags results in a good client experience. But I also mostly work on the backend while my co-founder mostly works on the frontend, so we have different desires and constraints. Ideally, as few requests as possible would make it to code that I wrote. With GraphQL that's nearly impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;STYLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; [slides] are not cue cards for the speaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Personally I disagree with this point and have developed a presentation style I'm happy with based on the slides being my cue cards (average 5-10 presentations / year for the last 15 years).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I do NOT read the talk from my slides and can't stand it when speakers do that! But, each slide should jog my memory of everything I need to say at that point. Maybe I'm talking about some stats as background, fine, the slide should be a bar chart of those stats, or a map, or an illustrative photo. Rarely a list of bullet points, though I don't prohibit them altogether and will tend to conclude with a list of bullets to leave in the background as a summary while I take questions. Overall the slides should complement the talk, not be a duplicate. But they serve a second function of reminding me of all the things I need to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;As a programmer you will appreciate the reason for this: I have cut the number of entities I have to process in my head from three (slides, audience, notes) to two (slides, audience). Keeping track of and having rapport with the audience is essential to me, even if that just means looking at people to see how engaged they are. With notes/memory in the equation I used to get a lot more nervous and not pay enough attention to the audience. Cutting out the notes allows me to focus on communicating better. It's a shared context, the audience can see exactly[1] what I can see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you're in sales then I see another tactic used instead, which is to memorize the talk so thoroughly that you don't need notes or presenter view. Fair enough. I'm an academic researcher; while they say all our presentations are a sales pitch on some level or other they clearly aren't expected to be as slick as &quot;sales&quot; sales. My constraints are having limited time to prepare, and wanting to stay natural. I do rehearse but I don't over-rehearse as I find that kills my own interest in the talk as well as taking more time. Usually the minimum for me is two full run throughs, probably stopping the clock multiple times during each to apply edits as I see fit (hopefully only a few edits second time).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;HANDLING CONTEXT SWITCHES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The one exception to [1] is context switches. As others have said, finding the perfect words for the &lt;em&gt;introduction&lt;/em&gt; to each new topic really helps get the flow going. These can be remembered, written on notes, written on slides, written on slide notes visible in presenter view, whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'm a big fan of presenter view, not for notes, but purely for the ability to see the next slide and introduce it slightly before the change. It helps to &lt;em&gt;leave&lt;/em&gt; each slide knowing what direction you're going in so you're not surprised by the next one. I do worry slightly that I'm dependent on presenter view and turn up early at each venue to make sure I can get it working (not all of them can).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;NERVES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Someone said don't drink too much alcohol. Based on my experience as a performing musician this is true :) Same goes for caffeine for the opposite reason, it really heightens the nerves. On the subject of nerves, just accept that some talks seem to go better than others. If you find yourself having a failure of confidence, take a deep breath and keep going. Easier said than done I know, but it always feels worse on the inside than it really looks; I have had people come up to me after talks where I thought I did awfully and tell me how engaging they found it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you can find a way to further engage the audience without forcing it - quiz questions, polls etc - go for it. Quiz questions can help set context for a new topic. Despite my love of the material I've never really been a lover of talks and can get pretty bored in the audience, so I really appreciate this sort of thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Example: on a few of my talks lately I've showed a picture of some protestors up trees by a road, asking who can name the incident. (Protests vs Newbury bypass construction). Followed by more protestors and an airstrip (former US nuclear base Greenham Common). Most of my UK audiences will get these right. Finally I asked what links these two things. They may or may not get the latter: the success of commercial development on Greenham Common, when it ceased to operate as an airbase, was blamed for the failure of transport models to correctly predict the effect of Newbury bypass. Doesn't matter whether anyone guessed the final answer, which is obviously a bit specialist. The point is I've now got people thinking about the many interconnected elements of simulating transport which is a great intro to the topic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;32.930584770719&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Remember you're telling a story. Think hard, before you start with slides, what that story actually is. Continuity and flow really matter.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Usually the first part of the story of a tech talk explains what the problem is. Many tech talks fail because the audience either doesn't understand the problem, or doesn't believe your problem needs solving. Think carefully who your audience are, and ensure you explain the problem in enough detail that you connect with your audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The middle part of a tech talk then is usually spent on explaining your solution to the problem. If you've explained the problem well, that the outline of the solution will basically work should be reasonably self-evident. Many tech talks fail here, because they dive too deep into the details too fast. Again, know your audience, so you know how deep to dive. You can never fit all the details you have in your head into a talk, so think carefully about what the most important features of your solution are, and focus on those. Keep less important details for backup slides you can turn to if asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The third part is usually evidence that your solution works. Often this involves graphs. Again, focus on only the most important results - more than about three graphs and your audience will switch off. Explain the experiment, and explain what the axes represent. Way too many people don't spend enough time on this, so no matter how good the data, no-one understood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Finally, your conclusions. What did you learn? How complete is it? What are its limitations? You're not entirely doing a sales job, and your audience are wise enough to know that your system will have limitations. You should be the one to explain them, rather than have them come out in questions (when they'll start to doubt eveything else you told them). Finally, what future directions do you think should be taken?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Of course, different talks have different shapes. Find what works for you. Sometimes you need to iterate between problem - solution - new problem - revised solution, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;When you present, know your first few sentences by heart, because you'll be nervous. After that, it matters less, you'll have settled into the talk, and you'll appear less stilted if you're not reciting a script. Most importantly, turn your excitement dial to 11. If the audience feel you're not excited by the work, why would they be? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;29.930037313433&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;As I moved into management I started to give more and more talks/presentations. A few very tech talks at summits and conventions with our peers, most were briefings directed at upper management, and while the content are different they function the same really.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I start by figuring out what I want my audience to take a way from the talk. Then I break it up in keywords and then I build my presentation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Once that is done I practice once or twice, by my self, talking to the computer while I rearrange, add or delete from the presentation to make it what I want it to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Once this is done I practice, going through the entire presentation until I’m able to give it on the fly if I was woken up at 4am. I don’t practice it word for word though, but when you’ve talked about a subject enough times, you can do it again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The practice but is really, really important. Especially if you’re not used to giving speeches. At first I thought that if I just practiced in my head, I’d be fine, because I knew what I wanted to say. Hah, not so. The first time I gave a presentation I was a stuttering incoherent mess, because I hadn’t practiced by saying the words out loud. I knew exactly what I wanted to say, I just couldn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Now, many years later, I don’t have to practice as much because I’ve gotten better verbally. So yo can definitely be the type of person who doesn’t need to practice out loud. But I had to do more than a thousand presentations to get to a point where I could comfortably skip practicing on short presentations and only doing it once or twice on long ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;As for questions afterwards, take your time to think about your answer, and if you don’t know the answer, then be honest and always, always be polite and affirmative. If you make people feel like they asked a good question, even when you think it wasn’t, then they and everyone around them will like you better. This too gets better with practice, but it’s obviously not something you can practice on your own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Humor is typically a good thing, it relies a lot in timing and it sometimes falls flat. Just never do it at someone’s expense. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;29.943566591422&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I'll give you what I do. I assume that tech talk here means seminar and not class. For a class I do things differently. First, write down the goal of the talk. What should the audience know, be able to do, etc. after this talk? If it's more than three bullet points, it's time to start cutting. Remember, in a talk, everyone is at the mercy of your pacing. Any given audience member will probably space out for at least five minutes of an hour talk, and if you're at a conference or embedded in a workday, they're already overwhelmed with information.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Then sketch an outline of presenting that information, just a rough order of what to touch on. I find that I naturally outline so that each entry is about five minutes, but I don't know if that's just me or a common tendency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Then I get a timer, stand up, and start talking to myself. I'll take an outline entry, and try to tell an imaginary audience about it. Typically I realize that I have some questions I need to answer for myself, or I run over five minutes. Think about how to drop stuff, look up what you need, note down what bits of verbiage came out that flowed well to reinforce them for yourself, and do it again. I often get frustrated after two or three times on one item, and go do another one, then come back to it and do it some more. During this whole process pretend the perfect slide to go with your text is up next to you so you can point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;After some cycles, this will converge. You will know what you want to say, and you will know what needs to be on the slides. Now set the timer for the full talk length and give the whole talk like this, still with pretend slides. You'll probably find places where you need transitional material, and it will probably run long despite the fact that the pieces add up to fit. Adjust. Do it again. This is also a good time to figure out and memorize the first couple sentences of each section, which will let you transition easily if you lose your place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;At this point you know your talk. Now go sketch your slides out on paper, and give your talk pointing to the paper. Once you think you have what you need figured out on paper, then go turn them into a PowerPoint, PDF, whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Now practice it with the slides. Practice starting from a section using those memorized sentences. Memorize your sequence of outline items with those sentences attached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Then do a run-through the day before. The day of, I spend five minutes thinking through my outline and section starting sentences, take a deep breath, and talk as inhumanly slow as you can. Even if you don't have stage fright (I don't), you will have adrenaline, and you need to slow down. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;35.931792345585&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;These are some things that I generally keep in mind whilst preparing or giving a talk. (These are just things I do, feel free to disagree.)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Preparing: 1) Give yourself enough time to write and practice the talk. If you can get ~1 month, that (for me atleast) is more than enough time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2) Say the words out loud when practicing. You may use different words or slightly improvise during the talk, which is totally fine. Just let yourself hear some version of it a few times (out loud) before presenting. In my experience this helps to avoid stutters, and keeps you in your place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3) Watch talks of people online that you enjoy or by people that inspire you. We all have our own &quot;style&quot; when it comes to public speaking. You will never be able to straight up copy someone. But watch and take mental notes as you do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4) (If you are preparing slides), keep them simple! It is YOU who is presenting the talk. Not a wall with a projector. Treat your slides mostly as an accessory. They can help illustrate a point perhaps, or outline the key subjects. Short and simple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Presenting: 1) If you can, make sure you have a bottle of water handy when you go up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2) When I approach the stand, platform or stage, I like to do so with confidence. This really does depend on the setting. But for example, as I walk up, sometimes I'll take my jacket off. Or do something that otherwise makes me feel like I'm owning the space. This makes me feel much more comfortable and puts me off to a good start. Even if you're not a confident person, walk up as if you are or do something simply to make you feel more comfortable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3) Don't be afraid to use the space you have been given. This goes both for actually walking around, and using your arms to assist your words. Hands out of pockets. Use them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4) Pauses are a good thing! Whether it's just to take a sip of water, or just a pause for the sake of pausing. This both gives you a few moments to collect your thoughts and also a few moments for the audience to digest what you have just been saying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;5) Slowww it down. It's almost too easy sometimes to rush talks when it comes down to actually presenting one. Take your time. They came to see you! So make it worth their while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;6) This is slightly tricky in some cases, but try to calibrate yourself towards the audience. For example, in my case, I've found people seem to pay more attention if I've just said something slightly amusing. If you can get away with it, go for it! It's a hard one to explain, but the bottom line is, try to get the crowd on the same page. I'll perhaps think of a better way of explaining this one and reply to this comment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;71.913793103448&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I have given many, many talks -- from dense technical presentations to generalized keynote addresses -- and have been doing it for over twenty years. Here, in my opinion, is the deal:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. Don't start your talk by apologizing. &quot;Well, first I need to apologize. I'm insanely jet lagged, and so I'm not sure how coherent this is going to be.&quot; &quot;First, I'd like to apologize. This is actually a revised version of a talk I gave in 2009.&quot; &quot;Let me start with an apology. I have a terrible head cold.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Just stop. If the talk is incoherent, you'll just have to do your best on the spot. If you're tired, too bad. If you think people might have trouble hearing you, say so. But don't &lt;em&gt;apologize&lt;/em&gt;. People do this because they're nervous, not because the audience has been insulted or aggrieved in some way, and while it might seem like a friendly gesture, it's more likely to communicate that you're unprepared. Or nervous. And it's a cliche.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. Do not ever go over time. In fact, go under time. As Edward Tufte once said, &quot;No one ever left a presentation wishing it had gone on for another 45 minutes&quot; (or something like that; you get the point).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. Do not read your goddamn slides to the audience. Please. That is not &quot;giving a talk.&quot; You can maybe do that if it's a long quote, but don't read the bullet points that everyone can clearly see right in front of them. Expand on them, provide counterpoints to them, whatever, but do not read them. If you're thinking of your slides (when you're creating them) as &quot;what I'm going &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; you're probably doing it wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4. Use a laser pointer sparingly or not at all. Use it only to make a precise gesture necessary to point something out very specifically on a chart or map, and then shut the thing off. Making dizzying circles around every bullet point is incredibly annoying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;5. &quot;Never mind the mic. Can everyone here me? I'm just going to speak loud.&quot; Unless you're very experienced with this (professional teacher, actor, or something like that), you probably don't know how to project your voice for twenty minutes. Get the mic fixed and use it. If the mic can't be fixed, speak way louder than you think you have to (without shouting). This is a learned skill, and most people don't know how to do it (but think they do). If the venue is large enough to require amplification, it's there for a reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;6. Speak at a moderate pace. People speak fast when they're nervous. The proper pace will feel a bit slow to you, but perfectly natural to the audience. Check yourself periodically. Write it down on your notes. Slow down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;7. If some parts of the information you're trying to communicate are very dense or there's some useful data that will help to contextualize your presentation, create a handout. Do not try to cram it all into a slide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;8. Take some time to try to imagine every conceivable question you might get in the Q&amp;amp;A. You won't hit them all, and things do come out of left field, but you don't want to be caught totally off guard. Just review any common misconceptions or objections to what you're saying, and give some thought to how you're going to respond. Some people just want to comment. Thank them, briefly offer a comment if appropriate, and move on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;9. If you feel the need to ask a question like, &quot;Does everyone know what a frubazzle is?&quot; don't. If the question is warranted, then you can be absolutely sure that someone in the audience doesn't know what that is. Just say, &quot;Some of you may not be familiar with the term, 'frubazzle.' A frubazzle is a . . .&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;10. Commit to getting better and better at it. When I gave my first talk (in grad school), I thought, &quot;It's going to be really embarrassing when I faint dead away in front of all these people,&quot; and I made a lot of mistakes. Today, I have only the slightest pang of nerves when I step up, and it goes away immediately. When you hear a good talk, try to figure what made it good. How did the speaker behave? How were the slides set up? Did they do anything that you can incorporate into your own presentation &quot;style?&quot; Public speaking is an ancient art, and you need to treat it as you would the art of writing or the art of coding: with care and study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description>

It's always been a ho-hum cert that attests to the fact that you once heard about this nmap thing, but it was cheap resume fodder for someone looking for their first industry position.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;They successfully lobbied the DoD to make it an option for 8570 compliance and, after becoming a government contractor, doubled the price immediately afterward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;CEH never taught anything useful or lasting even at its former price point, and it only exists now to soak up mandatory spending of government cheddar. (The cynic in me speculates that this was their intention all along.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Don't bother with it unless someone else is footing the bill. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Well, it's an entry level cert, as you say. Passing CEH doesn't mean someone knows what they're doing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That's not a problem with the certificate, it's a problem with people confusing it for an advanced qualification. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Some general recommendations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- follow smart security people on Twitter, which is the defacto medium for information security discussion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- read publicly disclosed bug bounty reports on Hackerone and Bugcrowd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- read The Tangled Web by Michal Zalewski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- learn to use Burp Suite &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Burp Suite is an awesome tool for devs as well. The Repeater tool is better for messing with API calls than any of the browser dev tools, imo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;25.872047244094&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I find that talking to folks in the trenches is incredibly useful. If you’re already at a company that has a security team, or even a small company that has folks that deal with infra/app security and/or incidents, you can learn a boatload directly the practitioners on the line. Even better if there’s a chat room that you can be a fly on the wall in.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;When I worked at Mashery (a SaaS API management company) we were the front end for the APIs of hundreds of companies around the world, handling billions of API calls for the likes of Comcast, Best Buy, Starbucks, Macy’s, etc. During my time there, I learned a god awful amount about ops, scaling, amd security, simply by sticking my head in whenever I detected chaos going down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Some comments mentioned tools like Metasploit, or reading up on the OWASP 10. Yup and yup. Plus, there are other tools to add to your belt that I find indispensable: Charles Proxy (install a MITM to watch web traffic), nmap (discover all the services running on a network) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;These are only relevant for web app testing, I haven't been able to find a suitable free resource for network testing but for paid resources OSCP is a great practice course if not pretty challenging for first timers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;21.868578255675&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If your goal is to land a job with the skills you acquire, you'll need more than just solid basic skills. It would be helpful to keep abreast of new developments, where there might not necessarily be a lot of training material yet.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;One way to keep up on what's new, is to watch the talks posted by security conferences. Speakers generally submit their freshest work, and are often playing their own game of resume-enhancement by getting their name associated with hot topics. So pay attention to not just the topics, but also the vocabulary around them...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A lot of the newest-fanciest research won't necessarily be within your grasp as a neophyte, but some of it will, and some of it will inform your direction and focus as you work your way up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;And some of it will suggest entirely new avenues, disciplines, and modes of thinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.owasp.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.owasp.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;WebGoat is a good way to put things in practice locally. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The project ZAP is a really great tool to help you in the process. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zaproxy.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.zaproxy.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Outside the web sphere, exploit database is a great site with a bunch of exploit code, explanation and papers. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.exploit-db.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.exploit-db.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The tool suite in Kali Linux is also very good if you don't mind read the documentation and try understanding the goal of the tools. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kali.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.kali.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Security is such a wide domain that you can quickly get flood. I don't think the ultimate step-by-step learning guide exists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Once you've learned and practiced a bit, if you don't give up too soon, you will get the point and understand how deep you need to go into a protocol or a system to actually do something yourself (then this not about security documentation anymore, but about understanding how the target works, and how you can make it work the way you want).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I would say that you need to focus on some targets first, and expand the scope over time depending on your needs/interests. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;10.92286115007&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;recommended way, 1. learn operating system internals, start using Linux 2. learn computer networking. TCP/IP, OSI layer and network protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP 3. learn about software programs and Web application architecture 4. start following up security related resource like books, videos, courses (OSCP is great).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Pick one programming language along the way and try scripting programs while learning. - you need not master every topic but knowledge of how and why everything works the way it works increases you expertise as security practitioner - since there are many public bug bounty programs these days, legally testing out stuffs to hone your knowledge has never been easy. plus you get paid. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>REST was never about CRUD</title>
<link>https://tyk.io/blog/rest-never-crud/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tyk.io/blog/rest-never-crud/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A popular myth is that REST-based APIs &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;must&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;be CRUD-based – that couldn’t be further from the truth. It is simply one pattern in our API design toolbox.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This article outlines a variety of additional patterns available for REST-based APIs. The intent isn’t to be fully exhaustive, but to open the options for API designers uncertain about how to apply designs beyond CRUD to REST-based APIs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quick review of CRUD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CRUD-based APIs refer to APIs that offer resource collections that contain instances, mimicking the (c)reate, (r)ead, (u)pdate, and (d)elete lifecycle pattern. The CRUD pattern is useful when we have a collection of resource instances that represent content or state. It often follows this familiar pattern:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;GET /articles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;– List/paginate/filter the list of available articles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;POST /articles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;– Create a new article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;GET /articles/{articleId}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;– Retrieve the representation of an article instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;PATCH /articles/{articleId}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;– Update specific fields for an article instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;DELETE /articles/{articleId}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;– Delete a specific article instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REST: Moving Beyond CRUD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before we explore patterns beyond CRUD, we need to address a serious misconception about REST:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is nothing about CRUD being a requirement for a “RESTful” API.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, I did a search in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fielding’s dissertation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, just to be certain, and found 0 results:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-25832&quot; src=&quot;https://tyk.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Fieldings-dissertation-.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fielding's dissertation&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;373&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When speaking about REST-based APIs, many conflate the idea of resources that utilize a CRUD-based pattern with REST itself. However, the idea of an HTTP resource is very abstract and not directly related to our database design:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.7098445595855&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This specification does not limit the scope of what might be a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;resource; rather, the term “resource” is used in a general sense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;for whatever might be identified by a URI.” –&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;RFC 3986&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, they can represent anything digital or physical:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;24.685534591195&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image, a source of information with a consistent purpose (e.g., “today’s weather report for Los Angeles”), a service (e.g., an HTTP-to-SMS gateway), and a collection of other resources. A resource is not necessarily accessible via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be resources. Likewise, abstract concepts can be resources, such as the operators and operands of a mathematical equation, the types of a relationship (e.g., “parent” or “employee”), or numeric values (e.g., zero, one, and infinity).” –&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;RFC 3986&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;REST is about constraining the way we interact between client and server, to take advantage of what the protocol (in this case, HTTP) offers. These constraints give us freedom to focus on our API design:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uniform interface&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;– requests from different clients look the same, whether the client is a browser, mobile device, or anything else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client-server separation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;– the client and the server act independently and the interaction between them is only in the form of requests and responses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stateless&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;– the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API, so all necessary information to process the request must be provided by the client on each request. Note: this isn’t about storing server-side state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layered system&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;– the client is agnostic as to how many layers, if any, there are between the client and the actual server responding to the request. This is a key principle of HTTP, allowing for caching servers, reverse proxies, and access security layering – all transparent to the client sending the request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacheable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;– the server response must contain information about whether or not the data is cacheable, allowing the client and/or intermediaries (see layered constraint, above) to cache data outside of the API server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code-on-demand (optional)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;– the client can request code from the server, usually in the form of a script, for client-side execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, there is nothing about REST requiring a resource with a CRUD-based lifecycle. CRUD is a pattern we can apply to our APIs, but it isn’t a requirement for composing a REST-based API.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This gives us a little more freedom when we design our APIs, as we can offer resources with a CRUD-based lifecycle when it is appropriate, while mixing in functional resources when CRUD isn’t necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We don’t have to be limited to this pattern when designing APIs. Let’s explore some other options that can help us design a great API that meet the needs of current and future developers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extending CRUD with additional lifecycle endpoints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A common situation in API design is the need to go beyond the typical CRUD interaction model. For example, some APIs may need to support actions such as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;approve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;decline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. With our somewhat limited action verbs in HTTP, how can we add this to our API?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One option that is taken is to use a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;field that is modified via a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;PATCH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;request. While this is one option, I like to take a slightly different approach by offering functional endpoints for my resource instances. For example, I might extend the CRUD-based design, above, with the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;POST /articles/{articleId}/submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;POST /articles/{articleId}/approve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;POST /articles/{articleId}/decline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;POST /articles/{articleId}/publish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this design, we have functional endpoints for our article instances within the collection, available via a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;action. Why might we take this approach? A few reasons:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our APIs can have better fine-grained access management at the API management layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, since each specific action is a unique URL that can be assigned different role-based access.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;We therefore decouple our access rights from the code into the deployment model, giving us flexibility to further restrict endpoint access without requiring code changes to enforce these restrictions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The workflow our API supports is more explicit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, as we don’t have to look at the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;PATCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;endpoint to understand the valid status values we can update, along with the state machine rules of what is allowed to be transitioned-to and when. Each endpoint declares this independently and more expressively&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, we are able to utilize hypermedia links more effectively&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;in our response payloads by offering unique URLs for the additional lifecycle endpoints. For example, the author might see the following API response:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;{ &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  “name”:”My new article”,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  “status”:”draft”,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  …&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  “_links”: [&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;    {“rel”:“submit”, “href”:”/articles/12345/submit”}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;While an editor might see the following, once the draft is submitted:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;{ &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  “name”:”My new article”,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  “status”:”submitted”,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  …&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  “_links”: [&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;    {“rel”:“approve”, “href”:”/articles/12345/approve”},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;    {“rel”:“decline”, “href”:”/articles/12345/decline”}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our clients are able to understand what action(s) are currently available to the client based on the user’s permissions (e.g. an editor might be able to approve, decline, and publish while an author may only be able to submit an article in draft mode) through the presence or absence of links to each of our lifecycle endpoints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is quite a powerful option for API designs that needs to go beyond the standard create, read, update, and delete actions for some or all of the resources it offers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional resources for search and calculations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if the capability we need to offer our consumers doesn’t require a collection of resources? What if we just need to compute a value and return it? Does that break our REST-based approach? It doesn’t have to, as long as we abide by the rules of HTTP and select the right action verb for the need, typically&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some common examples might include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;GET /search?q=api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;GET /postal-code-to-region?postalCode=78701&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;POST /calc-sales-tax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The common naming pattern I’ve seen for functional resources is in the form of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;verb-noun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;or sometimes just&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;verb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This makes it easy for the developer to understand it is a functional resource, rather than a resource collection that often follows the pluralized noun format (e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notice that the examples, above, require that you pass in all of the necessary information at once. Functional resources are an acceptable API design option, unless you begin to realize that the resource has a lifecycle (e.g. create, read) or has to capture state from the client. In this case, it is better to use stateful resources via the CRUD pattern to make it easier to interact with the resource collection and instances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transactional Resources for complex, long-running workflows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the days of SOAP and web services,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Transaction&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;WS-Transaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;was a specification designed to wrap multiple web service calls into a single, distributed transaction. This introduced considerable complexity to service design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a REST-based approach, we may still encounter complexities with our API design that require us to span transactions across multiple HTTP requests. Fear not – we have a solution that is much easier and flexible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Resources may be designed not just to represent business objects, but also long-running transactions or complex workflows. These resource collections represent the long-running transaction or workflow that we need to offer API consumers. Let’s look at an example that manages a reservation process for a hotel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;We first submit a request to create a new reservations resource instance with our desired room details, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;POST/reservations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;We then use this resource instance to capture or modify details about the reservation over time including start and end date, number of people in our party, additional requests, upsells, etc. This endpoint might be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;PATCH/reservations/abc1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which we will use as often as required until our reservation reflects the customer’s desired needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;For added flexibility and auditing purposes, each time we make a modification we may capture the change as a separate nested resource. This will allow us to pull a history of changes to our reservation, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;GET/reservations/abc1234/modifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If necessary, we can establish an expiration date for our reservation – perhaps 7 days after creation. If we try to make an update or pay for the reservation after the expiration, we would receive a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;400 Bad Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;or perhaps a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;409 Conflict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;When ready, the customer can submit a payment to our reservation instance, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;POST/reservations/abc1234/payments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result of a successful payment results in a booking, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;GET/bookings/ghurefh345&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subsequent changes to the booking would be handled directly, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;PATCH/bookings/ghurefh345&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but may trigger specific side-effects such as the need for additional payment or a partial or complete refund. This is because we are in a different context than the initial reservation process, one of a paying customer rather than someone shopping for a reservation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a powerful way to model a long-running transaction or workflow process, keep an audit trail of changes to the resource, and support an expiration period for transactions. All while staying within the constraints of a REST-based API design and avoiding added complexity on the API consumer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singleton resources: there can be only one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Singleton resources are useful when you do not require a collection of resources for your API. Singleton resources may represent a virtual resource for direct interaction of an existing resource instance, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;GET /me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in place of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;GET /users/12345&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;APIs may also offer nested singleton resources, when there is a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;one and only one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;relationship between the parent resource and its child resource, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;PUT /accounts/5678/preferences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Singleton resources may already exist without the need to create them, or they may require creation via a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;endpoint. While singleton resources may not offer the full spectrum of CRUD-style lifecycles like their collection-based brethren, they should still adhere to the proper selection of HTTP action verbs that best match the lifecycle necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulk and batch resource operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some resources require importing lots of data at once to prevent submitting 100s to 1000s of individual POST operations (a slow and tedious process). This is sometimes called ‘bulk’ or ‘batch’-based processing. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, I differentiate them in the following way:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulk operations&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;process each submitted record&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;independently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, allowing failures to be caught but the remainder of the import to succeed. This means that out of 2000 records, perhaps 76 of them failed while the remaining 1924 records were imported successfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bulk operations, such as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;POST /accounts/bulk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, should return a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;200 OK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;response code, along with a payload that indicates records that failed to import successfully. The response payload may also include successful records with their generated identifier, should the client wish to track success history for reporting or associate internal data with the identifier known by the remote API.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For bulk imports that will take longer than a few seconds, the API should return validate the request, queue the work to be done, then respond immediately a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;202 Accepted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;response along a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;header to the resource that represents the bulk import process details. Clients may then follow-up to see if the import was completed and obtain the results of the bulk import process, if so desired.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batch operations&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;process all submitted records within a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;single pass-or-fail transaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This means that if 76 records fail in a batch of 2000, none of the records were actually stored. The client will need to correct (or remove) the 76 failed records and resubmit the revised batch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Batch operations, such as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;POST /accounts/batch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, should return a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;200 OK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;if all records in the batch were stored successfully. In all other cases, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;400 Bad Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;may be returned along with a response payload that contains each of the records, the import status of each record, and any additional error details associated with each failed record.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For batch imports that will take longer than a few seconds, the API should return validate the request, queue the work to be done, then respond immediately a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;202 Accepted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;response along a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;header to the resource that represents the batch import process details. Clients may then follow-up to see if the import was completed and obtain the results of the batch import process, if so desired.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom-Embed Pattern: field-level selection and fetching nested resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using the zoom-embed pattern, the API supports more customization of the response payload to optimize the client-server interaction. This may be necessary in low-bandwidth networks or devices with limited-CPU capabilities. Clients are able to list the specific fields of a resource that they wish to have returned by the server while skipping those fields they do not need, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;GET /accounts/12345?fields=id,name,description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For resources that contain nested resources, clients are also able to specify additional nested resources to be returned within the response via a query parameter, e.g.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;GET /accounts/12345?include=preferences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This pattern prevents clients from making multiple roundtrips, where the client fetches a resource and is then forced to submit a separate HTTP request for each nested resource (sometimes referred to as the “n+1 request anti-pattern”).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This pattern was used successfully for the LinkedIn API, long before GraphQL, as shown below:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-25833&quot; src=&quot;https://tyk.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Examples.png&quot; alt=&quot;Examples&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;566&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By applying this pattern, we are able to have the best of both worlds: resource collections and instances that follow a CRUD pattern, plus more control for API consumers to select the amount of data returned without making multiple HTTP requests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When speaking about REST-based APIs, many conflate the idea of resources that utilize a CRUD-based pattern with REST itself. However, REST is a set of constraints that help our API mimic the best aspects of the web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For your next API design, I hope that you take the time to revisit these patterns and see if there are opportunities to incorporate one or more of them into your design to help make your API more evolvable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>REST was NEVER about CRUD - Tyk API Gateway and API Management</og:title>
<og:description>A popular myth is that REST-based APIs must be CRUD-based – that couldn’t be further from the truth. It is simply one pattern in our API design toolbox. This article outlines a variety of additional patterns available for REST-based APIs. The intent isn’t to be fully exhaustive, but to open the options for API designers uncertain about …</og:description>
