<title>I was blackmailed – any YouTuber could be next</title>
<link>https://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2020/05/26/I-Was-Blackmailed-Any-YouTuber-Could-Be-Next.aspx</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2020/05/26/I-Was-Blackmailed-Any-YouTuber-Could-Be-Next.aspx</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you follow Gamefromscratch on Twitter, you may have already &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gamefromscratch/status/1265105083106295814&quot;&gt;seen this tweet&lt;/a&gt; I put out last night about a blackmail demand that was made against our YouTube channel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=image_3508.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;804&quot; height=&quot;1052&quot; title=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=image_thumb_3474.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I really want to give a gigantic shout out to all of the people that helped get the message out, the tweets, retweets and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/gqojjn/game_from_scratch_channel_in_danger_because_of_a/&quot;&gt;even Reddit post&lt;/a&gt;.  You are an amazing community and hopefully if we yell loud enough, YouTube will here and fix this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically it started with a message in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamefromscratch.com/images/discosmall.png&quot;&gt;GFS Discord server&lt;/a&gt; claiming to have taken down my Animate CC video.  This video unfortunately has been taken down and reinstated 4 times in the last two months, this happened after YouTube turned up the bots responsibility due to Covid-19, so I had written it off as bots malfunctioning.  Each time it was taken down, I appealed and it would be restored.  After I didn’t pay the $50 in bitcoin, I started getting Circumvention of Technology notices for 3 of my videos.  That ultimately resulted in a community strike and loss of access to my channel for a week (or until appealed).  Thankfully those  three takedowns were reversed in about 2 hours and channel privileges were restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was just waiting for YouTube to restore my 2 year old Animate CC video… then to my shock, it was reviewed and found to be in violation!  Even after multiple previous reviews, as you can see from these email snippets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=YTEmailThread.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;904&quot; height=&quot;1441&quot; title=&quot;YTEmailThread&quot; alt=&quot;YTEmailThread&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=YTEmailThread_thumb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;So that is where things stand now.  My channel is back, 3 out of 4 of my videos are returned.  Thing is, anyone that wants can do this exact same attack whenever they want.  It was reported to YouTube and frankly they did nothing.  Any YouTube creator you love can have their channel taken down by spamming Circumvention of Technology claims, and there really isn’t anything you can do about it.  YouTube assumes your guilt and until the review clears you name, your video is down.  As you can see from the above emails, your video doesn’t always come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The single biggest piece of advice I can give to any YouTube creator, make sure your content is mirrored on another network!   After my Animate CC video was taken down the second time, I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://lbry.tv/$/invite/@gamefromscratch:1&quot;&gt;mirroring to Lbry.tv&lt;/a&gt; and I recommend you do to!  Thanks to mirroring to Lbry, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://lbry.tv/@gamefromscratch:1/adobe-animate-cc-2019-released:c&quot;&gt;Animate CC video lives on!&lt;/a&gt;  So if you want to try to spot the copyright circumvention YouTube reviewers “found”, you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Hopefully if we yell loud enough, YouTube will hear and creators will be protected from insanity like this in the future!  You can learn much more in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/DxBaOKvTtC8&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; below.  Once again, thank you to everyone that helped amplify my voice, it was and is much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How a lazy bitch like me learned to be productive</title>
<link>https://www.madisontaskett.com/lazy-bastard-productivity/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.madisontaskett.com/lazy-bastard-productivity/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but I've sadly never been able to stick with a productive schedule in the long run, even though I've &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to. I'd try to do all the things and then end up breaking my brain and quitting two weeks later. I didn't get it, how on Earth could other people get their productive selves together, and why did I suck so bad at keeping motivated? I thought I was just fucked, that it was something genetic that I would never have, but recently I figured out that people who can 'do it all', aren't immortal perfect beings like I'd secretly suspected. They just have a different system that works even when they aren't motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-couple-of-months-ago-i-was-a-train-wreck-that-ate-too-many-cinnamon-rolls-and-watched-netflix-while-laying-in-sweats-on-the-couch-yesterday-i-ran-3-miles-did-40-minutes-of-yoga-meditated-ate-steel-cut-oats-with-berries-for-breakfast-then-turned-on-my-favorite-business-podcast-while-i-showered-all-before-work-started-&quot;&gt;A couple of months ago, I was a train wreck that ate too many cinnamon rolls and watched Netflix while laying in sweats on the couch. Yesterday, I ran 3 miles, did 40 minutes of yoga, meditated, ate steel cut oats with berries for breakfast, then turned on my favorite business podcast while I showered, all before work started.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's almost effortless now. Like, wtf. Have I too become one of those insane Patrick Bateman-like beings that I thought all productive people were a few months ago? How did I finally pull it together? Here's the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of us can only do a small, small, &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; amount of hard work per day.&lt;/strong&gt; I mean &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; hard work, something we have to actively learn for the very first time vs it being a task that might take a lot of skill, but that's already programmed into us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard work is anything that's not already routine.&lt;/strong&gt; So, starting a workout program for example, is hard work because we have to break our existing schedules every day until it becomes second nature. Our brains love shortcuts, and we're forcing our minds to take the long route each morning that we introduce this new habit. Plus, we also have to learn how to do the workouts correctly, and that will feel really awkward and will take a lot of concentration over many weeks to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A world-class athlete probably works less than you do if you're just starting out, because even though they're doing things that your body can't even dream of doing right now, it's a habit to them. It's already programmed into their brain what to do, when they'll do it, and how to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're working harder than she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's routine to us, even if it takes a lot of skill, doesn't take as much effort as learning something new for the first time. This is how successful people can do so much highly-skilled work each week; a lot of it is already pre-programmed into the autopilot part of their brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since each new habit is really hard, going 'all-in' causes our brains to overload with too many new things at once, and we burn ourselves out.&lt;/strong&gt; Let's say I wanted to start writing a daily blog post, working out, and adopt a much healthier diet all at once. My brain still wants to spend an hour on YouTube every night so how does writing fit into my schedule and omg how do even I write again what if I suck and I burned my veggie lasagna bc I've never made it before ouch I think I pulled a muscle this morning because I don't have correct form in my workouts yet and where is my chocolate I want chocolate and... 💥&lt;em&gt;boom&lt;/em&gt;💥 after a couple of weeks, it all falls apart and I'm in my underwear watching &lt;em&gt;Love is Blind&lt;/em&gt;, face full of potato chips, silently hating myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year I discovered the &lt;strong&gt;lazy bastard approach to productivity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lazy-bastard-approach-add-one-or-two-high-quality-habits-each-month-and-implement-them-in-bite-sized-amounts-every-single-day-&quot;&gt;The lazy bastard approach = add one or two high quality habits each month, and implement them in bite-sized amounts every single day.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Three Rules:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I only make one or two habits each month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do them in &lt;em&gt;small quantities&lt;/em&gt; every single day&lt;/strong&gt; the first month-  I never push it too hard during the first 30 days, but I also do it every single day, no matter how I feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I never go over my goal for the first month.&lt;/strong&gt; So if my goal is to write for an hour daily I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; let myself go over one hour/day for the first month. This is to give my brain some peace of mind; if I set consistent expectations with it, then even on the days when I don't want to do my new habit, my brain knows there's a set end time/amount that I won't go over, and it reluctantly agrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I give my brain easily attainable, set boundaries that it can stick to for a long period of time. And then my brain actually does the things and doesn't give up and start watching Tiger King while internally judging the fuck out myself! Crazy stuff, right? &lt;strong&gt;And by adding a couple high-quality new habits each month, in 6 months I'm virtually unrecognizable.&lt;/strong&gt; Seriously, it's so easy and doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it works. I started in December with the simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c25k.com/&quot;&gt;Couch to 5K&lt;/a&gt; program. In January, I started writing one blog post each day. Nothing more. In March, I started listening to one high-value podcast daily. In April I took up short yoga sessions daily. This month, I'm writing 30 minutes a day on higher-value posts, and doing meditation for just 5 minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to this morning where I ran, did yoga, listened to a business podcast, and ate healthy all before work started. Compared to 6 months ago, when I'd wake up and stumble straight to the couch... I'm a 10x human. This is so cliche, but &lt;strong&gt;I feel better, I look better, and my mind is clearer. All because I admitted I was a lazy bitch and worked with it instead of trying to change myself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have the secret, too. So go forth with your lazy self, implement a couple small quality goals each month, and change the world! 💪&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;A Facebook Inc. team had a blunt message for senior executives. The company’s algorithms weren’t bringing people together. They were driving people apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness,” read a slide from a 2018 presentation. “If left unchecked,” it warned, Facebook would feed users “more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention &amp;amp; increase time on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That...

<title>The FBI investigating hacking of Covid research by “PRC-affiliated cyber actors”</title>
<link>https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/peoples-republic-of-china-prc-targeting-of-covid-19-research-organizations</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/peoples-republic-of-china-prc-targeting-of-covid-19-research-organizations</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are issuing this announcement to raise awareness of the threat to COVID-19-related research. The FBI is investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors and non-traditional collectors. These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research. The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI and CISA urge all organizations conducting research in these areas to maintain dedicated cybersecurity and insider threat practices to prevent surreptitious review or theft of COVID-19-related material. FBI is responsible for protecting the U.S. against foreign intelligence, espionage, and cyber operations, among other responsibilities. CISA is responsible for protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. CISA is providing services and information to support the cybersecurity of federal and state/local/tribal/territorial entities and private sector entities that play a critical role in COVID-19 research and response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assume that press attention affiliating your organization with COVID-19-related research will lead to increased interest and cyber activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patch all systems for critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely patching for known vulnerabilities of internet-connected servers and software processing internet data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively scan web applications for unauthorized access, modification, or anomalous activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve credential requirements and require multi-factor authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Victim Reporting and Additional Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI encourages victims to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices&quot; data-urltype=&quot;_direct_&quot; data-val=&quot;6d82bb7e4c5d4e81824bf9edcd286b85&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;resolveuid/6d82bb7e4c5d4e81824bf9edcd286b85&quot; data-linktype=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;local field office&lt;/a&gt;. For additional assistance and best practices, such as cyber hygiene vulnerability scanning, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/coronavirus&quot; data-urltype=&quot;/view&quot; data-val=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/coronavirus&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/coronavirus&quot; data-linktype=&quot;external&quot;&gt;cisa.gov/coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I won’t buy ebooks anymore</title>
<link>https://dustri.org/b/i-wont-buy-ebooks-anymore.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dustri.org/b/i-wont-buy-ebooks-anymore.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, an acquaintance of mine asked me if I was in possession of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fayard.fr/documents-temoignages/liberees-9782213705347&quot;&gt;particular e-book&lt;/a&gt;, and if yes, if she could borrow it from my (virtual) library. Unfortunately, I didn't have the desired piece of work, so I crawled the internet, and asked my friends if they had it, but alas, it was nowhere to be found, albeit everyone involved really wanted to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bought it. For the first time in my life, I bought an ebook, because it's 2020, so why not. I bought it on fnac.com, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnac&quot;&gt;one of the biggest&lt;/a&gt; retail chain selling cultural and electronic goods in France, for the low price of 7 euros. The advertised format was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB&quot;&gt;epub&lt;/a&gt;, an open standard, useable on a large number of supports. But surprise-surprise, to get the file, I needed either a specific kind of tablet (that I of course do not posses), or to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Digital_Editions&quot;&gt;Adobe Digital Editions&lt;/a&gt;: a Windows/OSX only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/08/adobe_says_it_slurps_ebook_data_in_plain_text_because_privacy_is_important/&quot;&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, it's written somewhere if you clic enough on the fnac's website that the book comes with DRM, but it's not in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to be able to import it in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibre_(software)&quot;&gt;calibre library&lt;/a&gt;. I had to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;download the file in a proprietary format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start a windows virtual machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install Adobe's crapware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accept its borderline illegal EULA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;navigate through a ton of security alerts because Windows doesn't like what Adobe's shitware is doing, at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;import the book in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install a shady software from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epubee.com/&quot;&gt;Chinese website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the DRM from the ebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;import the result in calibre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to downloading it from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://z-lib.org/&quot;&gt;Z library&lt;/a&gt; where the steps are literally &quot;download the epub, put it in calibre&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;ridiculous&lt;/strong&gt;. I guess I'm used to not deal with this kind of bullshit because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/&quot;&gt;gog.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nostarch.com/&quot;&gt;no starch press&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://libro.fm/&quot;&gt;libro.fm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://librivox.org/&quot;&gt;librivox&lt;/a&gt;, … who don't wrap the things they are selling in a thick layer of crap. Having DRM on books is a fucking dystopia nightmare that shouldn't even be a thing and I hope that the EU will pass laws to nuke them from orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Symbolic mathematics finally yields to neural networks</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/symbolic-mathematics-finally-yields-to-neural-networks-20200520/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/symbolic-mathematics-finally-yields-to-neural-networks-20200520/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;After coming up with this architecture, the researchers used a bank of elementary functions to generate several training data sets totaling about 200 million (tree-shaped) equations and solutions. They then “fed” that data to the neural network, so it could learn what solutions to these problems look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the training, it was time to see what the net could do. The computer scientists gave it a test set of 5,000 equations, this time without the answers. (None of these test problems were classified as “unsolvable.”) The neural net passed with flying colors: It managed to get the right solutions — precision and all — to the vast majority of problems. It particularly excelled at integration, solving nearly 100% of the test problems, but it was slightly less successful at ordinary differential equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For almost all the problems, the program took less than 1 second to generate correct solutions. And on the integration problems, it outperformed some solvers in the popular software packages Mathematica and Matlab in terms of speed and accuracy. The Facebook team reported that the neural net produced solutions to problems that neither of those commercial solvers could tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Into the Black Box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the results, the mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.wolfram.com/author/roger-germundsson/&quot;&gt;Roger Germundsson&lt;/a&gt;, who heads research and development at Wolfram, which makes Mathematica, took issue with the direct comparison. The Facebook researchers compared their method to only a few of Mathematica’s functions —“integrate” for integrals and “DSolve” for differential equations — but Mathematica users can access hundreds of other solving tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germundsson also noted that despite the enormous size of the training data set, it only included equations with one variable, and only those based on elementary functions. “It was a thin slice of possible expressions,” he said. The neural net wasn’t tested on messier functions often used in physics and finance, like error functions or Bessel functions. (The Facebook group said it could be, in future versions, with very simple modifications.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://me.ucsb.edu/people/fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-gibou&quot;&gt;Frédéric Gibou&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of California, Santa Barbara who has investigated ways to use neural nets to solve partial differential equations, wasn’t convinced that the Facebook group’s neural net was infallible. “You need to be confident that it’s going to work all the time, and not just on some chosen problems,” he said, “and that’s not the case here.” Other critics have noted that the Facebook group’s neural net doesn’t really understand the math; it’s more of an exceptional guesser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, they agree that the new approach will prove useful. Germundsson and Gibou believe neural nets will have a seat at the table for next-generation symbolic math solvers — it will just be a big table. “I think that it will be one of many tools,” Germundsson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides solving this specific problem of symbolic math, the Facebook group’s work is an encouraging proof of principle and of the power of this kind of approach. “Mathematicians will in general be very impressed if these techniques allow them to solve problems that people could not solve before,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/afha/anders/&quot;&gt;Anders Hansen&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible direction for the neural net to explore is the development of automated theorem generators. Mathematicians are increasingly investigating ways to use AI to generate new theorems and proofs, though “the state of the art has not made a lot of progress,” Lample said. “It’s something we’re looking at.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charton describes at least two ways their approach could move AI theorem finders forward. First, it could act as a kind of mathematician’s assistant, offering assistance on existing problems by identifying patterns in known conjectures. Second, the machine could generate a list of potentially provable results that mathematicians have missed. “We believe that if you can do integration, you should be able to do proving,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering assistance for proofs may ultimately be the killer app, even beyond what the Facebook team described. One common way to disprove a theorem is to come up with a counterexample that shows it can’t hold. And that’s a task that these kinds of neural nets may one day be uniquely suited for: finding an unexpected wrench to throw in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another unsolved problem where this approach shows promise is one of the most disturbing aspects of neural nets: No one really understands how they work. Training bits enter at one end and prediction bits emerge from the other, but what happens in between — the exact process that makes neural nets into such good guessers — remains a critical open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolic math, on the other hand, is decidedly less mysterious. “We know how math works,” said Charton. “By using specific math problems as a test to see where machines succeed and where they fail, we can learn how neural nets work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, he and Lample plan to feed mathematical expressions into their networks and trace the way the program responds to small changes in the expressions. Mapping how changes in the input trigger changes in the output might help expose how the neural nets operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaremba sees that kind of understanding as a potential step toward teaching neural nets to reason and to actually understand the questions they’re answering. “It’s easy in math to move the needle and see how well [the neural network] works if expressions are becoming different. We might truly learn the reasoning, instead of just the answer,” he said. “The results would be quite powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can 1/3 and 1/3 = 2/6? It seemed so</title>
<link>http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/can-1-3-1-3-2-6-it-seemed-so/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/can-1-3-1-3-2-6-it-seemed-so/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I was working with a class of fourth and fifth graders. Their teacher had begun a unit on fractions and was interested in connecting fractions to real-world contexts. “No problem,” I told her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan was that I would teach a lesson, she would observe, and then we’d revisit it. I’d focus on talking with students about naming fractional parts, the standard symbolism of fractions, and equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My first real-world context: a six-pack of water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2622&quot; src=&quot;http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Water.paint_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;292&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Water.paint_.jpg 292w, http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Water.paint_-150x150.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed the class the six-pack I had brought to class and talked about one bottle being 1/6 of the six-pack, two bottles being 2/6, three bottles being 3/6, and so on up to 6/6 being the same as the whole six-pack. The students seemed comfortable with this, and I wrote the fractions on the board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/6   2/6   3/6   4/6   5/6   6/6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talked about three bottles being one-half of the six-pack, and that 3/6 and 1/2 were equivalent fractions because they both described the same amount of the six pack. I recorded this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3/6 = 1/2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked what fraction of the six-pack would be gone after I drank four of the bottles and they answered 4/6 easily. I represented this numerically:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 4/6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked what fraction of the six-pack would be left after I drank four bottles, and they answered 2/6 easily. I represented this numerically with two equations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;6/6 – 4/6 = 2/6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 – 4/6 = 2/6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My second real-world context: a box of 12 pencils&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2620&quot; src=&quot;http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Pencils.paint_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;243&quot; height=&quot;155&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued with a different context—a box of 12 pencils. We talked about one pencil being 1/12 of the box, two pencils being 2/12, three pencils being 3/12, and so on. I wrote these fractions on the board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/12  2/12  3/12  4/12  5/12  6/12  7/12  8/12  9/12  10/12  11/12  12/12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pencil box gave us a way to talk about another equivalent fraction for 1/2, this time 6/12. And I talked about 12/12 representing the pencils in the whole box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;6/12 = 1/2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;12/12 = 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked, “If I give a pencil to each of five students, what fraction of the pencils would I have given away?”  They answered easily and I recorded numerically:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/12 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 1/12 = 5/12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if 5/12 represented more or less than half the box, and they agreed that it was less than half. I recorded again:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5/12 &amp;lt; 1/2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked a few other questions, recording numerically for each. All this was going fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I hit a snag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The students in this class sat in small groups, and I next called the students’ attention to a table where two boys and one girl were seated. I asked them what fractional part of the students at the table were girls. Hands shot up and I had them say the fraction in unison in a whisper voice—one-third. I wrote &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2619&quot; src=&quot;http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/One-Table.paint_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;312&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/One-Table.paint_.jpg 312w, http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/One-Table.paint_-300x277.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad noticed that the table next to his also had two boys and one girl sitting at it. Claudia commented, “So if you put the two tables together, then 2/6 would be girls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2621&quot; src=&quot;http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Two-Tables.paint_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;618&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Two-Tables.paint_.jpg 618w, http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Two-Tables.paint_-300x140.jpg 300w, http://www.marilynburnsmathblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Two-Tables.paint_-600x280.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addison’s hand shot up. “Can I come up and write that in fractions?” he asked. I agreed. Addison came up and wrote on the board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/3 + 1/3 = 2/6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned. Addison was correct that 2/6 of the students at the two tables were girls. But the addition equation that Addison wrote wasn’t correct. It’s every teacher’s nightmare when students combine the numerators and denominators to add fractions and think that adding 1/3 and 1/3, for example, gives an answer 2/6. But I didn’t think that Addison had applied that incorrect procedure. I wasn’t sure exactly what he was thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To buy some time, I asked Addison to explain what he had written. He said, “One out of three at Brad’s table is a girl, so that’s one-third. And it’s the same for Margaux’s table. So, if you put them together, then two out of all six kids are girls, and that’s two-sixths.” The rest of the students nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were all pleased. I was a wreck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for buying some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s hard to think and teach at the same time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I stood quietly and thought for a moment about what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill the quiet, I said to the class, “When thinking about fractions, it’s important to keep your attention on what the whole is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They nodded politely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thinking some more, I returned to the context of the two tables of students. I said to Addison, “I see that you’re thinking about the two tables together.” He nodded. “So, the group of students at the two tables together has six students.” He nodded again. “Then Brad, Samantha, Jack, Margaux, Robbie, and Max, are each 1/6 of that group, just as each bottle of water is 1/6 of the whole six-pack.” Another nod. And because 1/6 + 1/6 equals 2/6, it makes sense to me that 2/6 of that group of six are girls.” I wrote on the board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the students seemed concerned that 1/3 + 1/3, as Addison had written, seemed to produce the same answer as 1/6 + 1/6, as I had written. Now I was breaking out into a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tried again to explain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“Let’s look at just one of the tables,” I suggested. “There are three students—Brad, Samantha, and Jack. What fraction of the table does Brad represent?” The students answered 1/3 easily. “And what fraction does Jack represent?” They answered 1/3 again. “And what fraction of the table are boys?” They answered 2/3. I wrote on the board, underneath what Addison had written:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/3 + 1/3 = 2/6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey,” Addison said. “You got a different answer to 1/3 plus 1/3.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you do now????? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ZSH Aliases</title>
<link>https://thorsten-hans.com/5-types-of-zsh-aliases</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thorsten-hans.com/5-types-of-zsh-aliases</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My shell means everything to me. It is the first program I start in the morning and the last one I close in the evening. It is the program that I regularly tweak to boost my overall productivity. From my perspective, Microsoft’s release of Windows Terminal 1.0 and WSL 2.0 will boost overall Shell adoption. Over the past decade, I have seen numerous users installing and using different shells. However, the number of people that invest time in configuring their shell to be more productive is just a small percentage. And that is a shame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also stick with tools like Finder or Windows Explorer if you install and use a shell without customizing it. Shells like ZSH shine once they have individual configurations: configurations that make you - the user - super productive. I wrote this article for inspiration. It should demonstrate how you can increase your overall productivity with simple things like adopting the 5 types of aliases in ZSH. Aliases are the first step towards a tailored shell experience. Aliases are a super individual thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Docker, Kubernetes, and Microsoft Azure every day. That said, it makes sense for me to have aliases supporting me with these tools and environments. However, maybe you are using different clouds and command-line tools so that you will end up with different aliases. The key takeaway should be that you create and use aliases to help you get your job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All your aliases are defined in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;. ZSH loads the configuration file during startup. However, you can always force to reload your configuration file use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source ~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will teach you how to create and use these five types of aliases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simple-aliases&quot;&gt;Simple Aliases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple Aliases are a good starting point. I use them to reduce the number of keystrokes to fire up a command. The definition of a simple alias uses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alias my-alias=&quot;command&quot;&lt;/code&gt; pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# navigation aliases&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cd ~/dev/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;personal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cd ~/dev/thorstenhans&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;business&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cd ~/dev/thinktecture&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# kubectl aliases&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;kubectl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;kgx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;kubectl config get-contexts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# docker aliases&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;docker&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;docker ps&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having those aliases registered in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;, I can navigate quickly to commonly used directories and to fire-up commands that I use frequently using just a few keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;suffix-aliases&quot;&gt;Suffix Aliases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffix Aliases are defined using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; flag. With suffix aliases, you can launch files with a specific extension (or suffix) in your favorite tool. To register a suffix alias, we use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alias -s extension=name-of-the-tool&lt;/code&gt; pattern. The following samples assume that VisualStudio Code is installed and can be launched using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; command from the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Azure CLI files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;azcli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;code

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Markdown files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;code

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# JSON files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;code

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# bulk association&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;cs,ts,html&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}=&lt;/span&gt;code
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load the modified &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; and execute the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#Hello World&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; sample.md

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# now type the name of the file and commit via ENTER&lt;/span&gt;
sample.md

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suffix alias translates &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sample.md&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code sample.md&lt;/code&gt;, and you should see VisualStudio Code launching and showing the content of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sample.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;functions-for-aliases-with-parameters&quot;&gt;Functions for Aliases With Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want to create aliases the require some contextual information. Parameters are used to describe this contextual information for shell commands. The registration of aliases with parameters looks pretty similar to a function definition in regular programming languages. We use the following pattern to define aliases with parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;aliasname&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$firstParam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$secondParam&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider you want to optimize the process of listing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instances in your Azure Subscription. To achieve this, Azure CLI provides the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;az aks list&lt;/code&gt; command. The command allows further configuration by adding several parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following alias accepts two parameters—first, the Resource Group Name (Resource Groups are logical containers in Azure). The second parameter specifies the desired output format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;getaks&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  az aks list &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getaks&lt;/code&gt; alias with parameters to look for AKS instances in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resource-group-1&lt;/code&gt; and print results in colored JSON (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jsonc&lt;/code&gt;) using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getaks resource-group-1 jsonc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;global-aliases&quot;&gt;Global Aliases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global aliases are defined using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; flag. A global alias is aggressive. Once registered, it replaces all occurrences of the alias name with the specified command. The definition follows the pattern &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alias -g aliasName=&quot;command&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# I have to ask for Azure Resource Ids frequently&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;qId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;--query id -o tsv&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;qId&lt;/code&gt; registered as a global alias, I can optimize my performance when asking for unique resource identifiers using Azure CLI. See the following snippet comparing the regular command, to the optimized one using my global alias:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# proper command to query the identifier of an AKS instance&lt;/span&gt;
az aks show &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; myaks2020 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; rg-demo &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; tsv

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# command to query the identifier of an AKS instance with global alias&lt;/span&gt;
az aks show &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; myaks2020 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; rg-demo qId
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;operating-system-specific-aliases&quot;&gt;Operating system specific aliases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An operating system specific alias is not a real type. However, I think platform-specific aliases are important—especially when using multiple platforms. I use macOS as a daily driver, so I also have some aliases tied to my rig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I love VisualStudio Codespaces that are using Linux as an operating system. In both situations, I want to use my dotfiles. To achieve this, I use simple &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;-statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# macOS aliasses&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$OSTYPE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; darwin&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;flush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'dscacheutil -flushcache'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Apps&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;browse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;open -a /Applications/Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Chrome.app&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# * Browse Azure Portal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;azure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;browse https://preview.portal.azure.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the following image showing all my platform related aliases for macOS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thorsten-hans.com/assets/images/posts/2020/zsh-aliases-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;5 alias types in zsh - platform specific aliases&quot;/&gt; Platform specific aliases in ZSH
&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-aliases-to-edit-and-reload-zshrc-&quot;&gt;Use Aliases To Edit and Reload .zshrc &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two aliases in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;, which are super-efficient. I open my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; in my favorite editor with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ec&lt;/code&gt; and source it (apply the current state of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; to your ZSH session) with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sc&lt;/code&gt;. The alias definition for both looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# open ~/.zshrc in using the default editor specified in $EDITOR&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/.zshrc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# source ~/.zshrc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;source &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/.zshrc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-&quot;&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have seen five different types of ZSH aliases (counting os-specific aliases as dedicated type) that will boost your productivity. Foud different types of aliases used to achieve almost everything in your shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your time. Do some research. Identify the command-line tools you are using daily or regularly, find patterns, and create corresponding aliases that increase your productivity by reducing keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having powerful shells on all operating systems (finally including windows using WSL 2.0), you should care about your shell performance. Make ZSH your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of conference speaking; if you are presenting at conferences or meetups too, you should start your presentation by quickly explaining the aliases you will use throughout the talk to onboard your audience. Maybe they are using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kc&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;. 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/learnbyexample&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sundeep Agarwal&lt;/a&gt; for pointing me to some typos and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smhmd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;simohamed&lt;/a&gt; for the tip regarding bulk association for suffix aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
