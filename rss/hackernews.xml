<title>Facebook won‚Äôt let you opt-out of its phone number ‚Äòlook up‚Äô setting</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/03/facebook-phone-number-look-up/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/03/facebook-phone-number-look-up/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Users are complaining that the phone number &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; hassled them to use to secure their account with two-factor authentication has also been associated with their user profile ‚Äî which anyone can use to ‚Äúlook up‚Äù their profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, Facebook doesn‚Äôt give you an option to opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Facebook was forced to admit that after months of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/fixing-sms-notifications-for-those-using-two-factor-authentication/10155124741945766/&quot;&gt;pestering its users&lt;/a&gt; to switch on two-factor by signing up their phone number, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/yes-facebook-is-using-your-2fa-phone-number-to-target-you-with-ads/&quot;&gt;also using those phone numbers&lt;/a&gt; to target users with ads. But some users are finding out just now that Facebook‚Äôs default setting allows everyone ‚Äî with or without an account ‚Äî to look up a user profile based off the same phone number previously added to their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent hubbub began today after &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyburge/status/1101402001907372032&quot;&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; by Jeremy Burge blew up, criticizing Facebook‚Äôs collection and use of phone numbers, which he likened to ‚Äúa unique ID that is used to link your identity across every platform on the internet.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;6.6071428571429&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;7.4330357142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For years Facebook claimed the adding a phone number for 2FA was only for security. Now it can be searched and there's no way to disable that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zpYhuwADMS&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zpYhuwADMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äî Jeremy Burge üê•üßø (@jeremyburge) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyburge/status/1101402001907372032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although users can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/117118145038822&quot;&gt;hide their phone number&lt;/a&gt; on their profile so nobody can see it, it‚Äôs still possible to ‚Äúlook up‚Äù user profiles in other ways, such as ‚Äúwhen someone uploads your contact info to Facebook from their mobile phone,‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/131297846947406&quot;&gt;according to a Facebook help article&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs a more restricted way than allowing users to search for user profiles using a person‚Äôs phone number, which Facebook restricted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43656746&quot;&gt;last year after admitting ‚Äúmost‚Äù users had&lt;/a&gt; their information scraped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook gives users the option of allowing users to ‚Äúlook up‚Äù their profile using their phone number to ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù by default,¬†or to ‚Äúfriends of friends‚Äù or just the user‚Äôs ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there‚Äôs no way to hide it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security expert and academic Zeynep Tufekci said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1101877937069088768?s=12&quot;&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;: ‚ÄúUsing security to further weaken privacy is a lousy move ‚Äî especially since phone numbers can be hijacked to weaken security,‚Äù referring &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/what-happens-when-hackers-steal-your-sim-you-learn-to-keep-your-crypto-offline/&quot;&gt;to SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;, where scammers impersonate cell customers to steal phone numbers and break into other accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;8.2142857142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;See thread! Using security to further weaken privacy is a lousy move‚Äîespecially since phone numbers can be hijacked to weaken security. Putting people at risk. What say you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@facebook&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/9qKtTodkRD&quot;&gt;https://t.co/9qKtTodkRD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äî zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1101877937069088768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 2, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tufekci‚Äôs argued that users can ‚Äúno longer keep keep private the phone number that [they] provided only for security to Facebook.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook spokesperson Jay Nancarrow told TechCrunch that the settings ‚Äúare not new,‚Äù adding that, ‚Äúthe setting applies to any phone numbers you added to your profile and isn‚Äôt specific to any feature.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gizmodo &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051&quot;&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; that when a user gives Facebook a phone number for two-factor, it ‚Äúbecame targetable by an advertiser within a couple of weeks.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user doesn‚Äôt like it, they can set up two-factor without using a phone number ‚Äî which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/two-factor-authentication-for-facebook-now-easier-to-set-up/10155341377090766/&quot;&gt;hasn‚Äôt been mandatory for additional login security&lt;/a&gt; since May 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if users haven‚Äôt set up two-factor, there are well documented cases of users having their phone numbers collected by Facebook, whether the user expressly permitted it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, one reporter for The Telegraph &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/08/09/how-did-facebook-get-my-number-and-why-is-it-giving-my-name-out/&quot;&gt;described her alarm at the ‚Äúlook up‚Äù feature&lt;/a&gt;, given she had ‚Äúnot given Facebook my number, was unaware that it had found it from other sources, and did not know it could be used to look me up.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp, the messaging app also owned by Facebook (alongside Messenger and Instagram), uses your phone number as the primary way to create your account and connect you to its service. Facebook has long had a strategy to further &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/facebook-fined-122m-in-europe-over-misleading-whatsapp-filing/&quot;&gt;integrate&lt;/a&gt; the two services, although it has run into &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/facebook-fined-122m-in-europe-over-misleading-whatsapp-filing/&quot;&gt;some bumps&lt;/a&gt; along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the specific concerns by users, Facebook said: ‚ÄúWe appreciate the feedback we‚Äôve received about these settings and will take it into account.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerned users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy&amp;amp;section=findphone&amp;amp;view&quot;&gt;should switch their ‚Äúlook up‚Äù settings&lt;/a&gt; to ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù to mitigate as much of the privacy risk as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked specifically if Facebook will allow users to users to opt-out of the setting, Facebook said it won‚Äôt comment on future plans. And, asked why it was set to ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù by default, Facebook said the feature makes it easier to find people you know but aren‚Äôt yet friends with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others criticized Facebook‚Äôs move to expose phone numbers to ‚Äúlook ups,‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1102213461906464768&quot;&gt;calling it ‚Äúunconscionable.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/alex-stamos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;alex-stamos&quot;&gt;Alex Stamos,&lt;/a&gt; former chief security officer and now adjunct professor at Stanford University, also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1101963987602690048&quot;&gt;called out the practice&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet. ‚ÄúFacebook can‚Äôt credibly require two-factor for high-risk accounts without segmenting that from search and ads,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-loses-its-chief-security-officer-alex-stamos/&quot;&gt;Stamos left Facebook in August&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook has not hired a replacement chief security officer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Session Types for Rust</title>
<link>https://github.com/Munksgaard/session-types</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/Munksgaard/session-types</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Session Types for Rust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://munksgaard.me/papers/laumann-munksgaard-larsen.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;session types for Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this library, you can implement &lt;strong&gt;bi-directional process communication&lt;/strong&gt; with compile-time assurance that neither party will violate the communication protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/Munksgaard/session-types&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9da8cd2e8f34b7abe7e292def27782c3aa7d1c8d/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f4d756e6b7367616172642f73657373696f6e2d74797065732e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572&quot; alt=&quot;Build Status&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/Munksgaard/session-types.svg?branch=master&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/session_types&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c8c0bfa660239c22bf3fc51950865f00c3a64827/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6372617465732f762f73657373696f6e5f74797065732e737667&quot; alt=&quot;Cargo&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/crates/v/session_types.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.rs/session_types&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1ea7e7ef6c9053e72af7246eac606eb8b9b6a7cc/68747470733a2f2f646f63732e72732f73657373696f6e5f74797065732f62616467652e737667&quot; alt=&quot;Documentation&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://docs.rs/session_types/badge.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/session_types&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;session-types is available on crates.io&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended to look there for the newest released version, as well as links to the newest builds of the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point of the last update of this README, the latest published version could be used like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following dependency to your Cargo manifest...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-toml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;session_types&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;0.2.0&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.rs/session_types/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt; session_types;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; session_types&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;;

        c.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;()
    }
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;cli&lt;/span&gt;(c: Chan&amp;lt;(), Client&amp;gt;) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; c.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;(n);
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; (c, b) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; c.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;recv&lt;/span&gt;();

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; b {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;{} is even&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, n);
    } &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;{} is odd&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, n);
    }

    c.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;();
}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;() {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; (server_chan, client_chan) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;session_channel&lt;/span&gt;();

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; srv_t &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; thread&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;spawn&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;move&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;srv&lt;/span&gt;(server_chan));
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; cli_t &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; thread&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;spawn&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;move&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;cli&lt;/span&gt;(client_chan));

    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; _ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; (srv_t.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;(), cli_t.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;());
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by specifying a &lt;em&gt;protocol&lt;/em&gt;. Protocols are constructed from the protocol types &lt;code&gt;Send&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Recv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Choose&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Offer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Rec&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Var&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Munksgaard/session-types#protocol-types&quot;&gt;Protocol types&lt;/a&gt;). In this case, our protocol is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Server&lt;/span&gt; = Recv&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;i64&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;, Eps&amp;gt;&amp;gt;;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Receive a signed 64-bit integer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a boolean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; protocol is the &lt;em&gt;dual&lt;/em&gt;, which is a well-defined concept in session types. Loosely, it means that every protocol step in one process has a matching step in the other. If one process wants to send a value, the other process must be ready to receive it. The dual of &lt;code&gt;Server&lt;/code&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;i64&lt;/span&gt;, Recv&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;, Eps&amp;gt;&amp;gt;;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;session-types&lt;/code&gt;, we do not have to construct the dual by hand, as we leverage the trait system to model this concept with the &lt;code&gt;HasDual&lt;/code&gt; trait. This allows us to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt; = &amp;lt;Server as HasDual&amp;gt;::Dual;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is it cool?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session types are not a new concept. They are cool, because they allow for &lt;em&gt;compile-time&lt;/em&gt; verification of process communication. In other words, we are able to check statically if two communicating processes adhere to their shared communication protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But implementing session types requires a way to model that certain actions in the protocol have taken place. This is a complicated thing to do statically in most programming languages, but in Rust it is easy because of &lt;em&gt;move semantics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using move semantics, we ensure that &quot;taking a step&quot; in the protocol (sending, receiving, etc) cannot be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protocol types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any session-typed communication protocol is constructed from some basic building blocks. This section goes through them pair-wise, showing an action and its dual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A session-typed channel is defined as &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;E, P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;environment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; is a protocol. The environment &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; is always &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; for newly created channels (ie it is empty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;Eps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final step of any terminating protocol. The simplest example is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type Close = Eps;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any channel whose type is &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;E, Eps&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implements the &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt; method that closes the connection. &lt;code&gt;Eps&lt;/code&gt; is its own opposite, ie &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Close as HasDual&amp;gt;::Dual = Eps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest channels are of type &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;(), Eps&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. All you can do with such channels is to close the connection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;let (a, b) = session_channel::&amp;lt;Eps&amp;gt;();
a.close();
b.close();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;Send&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Recv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the most basic of actions: Transmitting and receiving values. The opposite of a &lt;code&gt;Send&lt;/code&gt; with some type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;Recv&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type S = Send&amp;lt;String, Eps&amp;gt;;
type R = Recv&amp;lt;String, Eps&amp;gt;; // &amp;lt;S as HasDual&amp;gt;::Dual
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A channel of type &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;E, Send&amp;lt;T, P&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implements the method &lt;code&gt;send(T) ‚Üí Chan&amp;lt;E, P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A channel of type &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;E, Recv&amp;lt;T, Q&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implements the method &lt;code&gt;recv() ‚Üí (T, Chan&amp;lt;E, Q&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;Choose&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Offer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the option of making choices in the protocol, for one process to inform the other of a decision. The &lt;code&gt;Choose&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Offer&lt;/code&gt; constructs model such choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type C = Choose&amp;lt;Send&amp;lt;String, Eps&amp;gt;, Recv&amp;lt;String, Eps&amp;gt;&amp;gt;;
type O = Offer&amp;lt;Recv&amp;lt;String, Eps&amp;gt;, Send&amp;lt;String, Eps&amp;gt;&amp;gt;; // &amp;lt;C as Hasdual&amp;gt;::Dual
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A channel of type &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;E, Choose&amp;lt;P, Q&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implements &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sel1() ‚Üí Chan&amp;lt;E, P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sel2() ‚Üí Chan&amp;lt;E, Q&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;that communicates the choice of protocols &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; to the other process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A channel of type &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;E, Offer&amp;lt;P, Q&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implements &lt;code&gt;offer() ‚Üí Branch&amp;lt;Chan&amp;lt;E, P&amp;gt;, Chan&amp;lt;E, Q&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Branch&lt;/code&gt; is an enum defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;enum Branch&amp;lt;L, R&amp;gt; {
    Left(L),
    Right(R),
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to &lt;code&gt;offer()&lt;/code&gt; should then be matched on to figure out which path the other process decided to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;match c.offer() {
    Branch::Left(c) =&amp;gt; ‚Ä¶,
    Branch::Right(c) =&amp;gt; ‚Ä¶,
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rec&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Var&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type &lt;code&gt;Rec&lt;/code&gt; implements the ability the recurse in the protocol, ie provides an iterator component. The type &lt;code&gt;Rec&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; allows repeating the protocol &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A channel of type &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;E, Rec&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implements the method &lt;code&gt;enter() ‚Üí Chan&amp;lt;(P, E), P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Calling &lt;code&gt;enter()&lt;/code&gt; &quot;stores&quot; the protocol &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; in the channel environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Var&lt;/code&gt; construct is then used to reference protocols stored in the environment. As the environment is essentially a stack, &lt;code&gt;Var&lt;/code&gt; takes a counter that is modeled as a Peano number. &lt;code&gt;Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; points to the top of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A channel of type &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;(P, E), Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implements the method &lt;code&gt;zero() ‚Üí Chan&amp;lt;(P, E), P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, ie &lt;code&gt;Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is replaced by &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; at the top of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type RS = Rec&amp;lt;Send&amp;lt;String, Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;;
type RR = Rec&amp;lt;Recv&amp;lt;String, Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;; // &amp;lt;RS as HasDual&amp;gt;::Dual
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following program indefinitely sends some string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;let c: Chan&amp;lt;(), Rec&amp;lt;Send&amp;lt;String, Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; = ‚Ä¶;
let mut c = c.enter();
loop {
    c = c.send(&quot;Hello!&quot;.to_string()).zero();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocols in the environment can also be popped from the stack with &lt;code&gt;Var&amp;lt;S&amp;lt;N&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This requires there to be at least one protocol in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A channel of type &lt;code&gt;Chan&amp;lt;(P, E), Var&amp;lt;S&amp;lt;N&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implements the method &lt;code&gt;succ() -&amp;gt; Chan&amp;lt;E, Var&amp;lt;N&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that peels away the &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; from the environment and &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; in the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the constructions from above allows us put together more complex protocols. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type Server = Rec&amp;lt;
                  Offer&amp;lt;
                      Eps,
                      Recv&amp;lt;String, Send&amp;lt;usize, Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
                  &amp;gt;
              &amp;gt;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a loop, either:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Close the connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Receive a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send back a &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the beginning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;let c: Chan&amp;lt;(), Server&amp;gt; = ‚Ä¶;
let mut c = c.enter();                  // c: Chan&amp;lt;(Offer&amp;lt;‚Ä¶&amp;gt;, ()), Offer&amp;lt;‚Ä¶&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
loop {
    c = match c.offer() {
        Branch::Left(c) =&amp;gt; {            // c: Chan&amp;lt;(Offer&amp;lt;‚Ä¶&amp;gt;, ()), Eps&amp;gt;
            c.close();
            break
        },
        Branch::Right(c) =&amp;gt; {           // c: Chan&amp;lt;(Offer&amp;lt;‚Ä¶&amp;gt;, ()), Recv&amp;lt;String, Send&amp;lt;usize, Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
            let (c, str) = c.recv();    // c: Chan&amp;lt;(Offer&amp;lt;‚Ä¶&amp;gt;, ()), Send&amp;lt;usize, Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
            let c = c.send(str.len());  // c: Chan&amp;lt;(Offer&amp;lt;‚Ä¶&amp;gt;, ()), Var&amp;lt;Z&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
            c.zero()                    // c: Chan&amp;lt;(Offer&amp;lt;‚Ä¶&amp;gt;, ()), Offer&amp;lt;‚Ä¶&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
        }
    };
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Use this Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book was written and tested with Python 3.5, though other Python versions (including Python 2.7) should work in nearly all cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book introduces the core libraries essential for working with data in Python: particularly &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipython.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://numpy.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Scikit-Learn&lt;/a&gt;, and related packages. Familiarity with Python as a language is assumed; if you need a quick introduction to the language itself, see the free companion project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython&quot;&gt;A Whirlwind Tour of Python&lt;/a&gt;: it's a fast-paced introduction to the Python language aimed at researchers and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The MBA Myth and the Cult of the CEO</title>
<link>https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1db3jy3201d38/The-MBA-Myth-and-the-Cult-of-the-CEO</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1db3jy3201d38/The-MBA-Myth-and-the-Cult-of-the-CEO</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Harvard Business School professor Michael Jensen co-wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/1990/05/ceo-incentives-its-not-how-much-you-pay-but-how&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; making the then-bold claim that CEO compensation should be tied to stock price performance. The point, Jensen and his co-author argued, was to better align incentives and ensure that corporations were able to attract ‚Äúthe best and brightest individuals to careers in corporate management.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: Pay up, or lose out.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Jensen was little known outside academic circles. But ‚Äî perhaps unsurprisingly ‚Äî his advocacy for a new model of CEO pay quickly made him a well-known name in business academia and corporate boardrooms, sought after for advice and affirmation. Soon, ‚Äúaligning incentives‚Äù exploded across corporate America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were staggering. According to data from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, average CEO compensation at the largest firms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-quick-guide-17-ceo-compensation-data.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt; from $1.8 million per year in the 1980s ‚Äî roughly in line with the previous 45 years ‚Äî to $4.1 million in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, it had risen to $9.2 million. And those numbers are &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; adjusting for inflation. The majority of that growth came in the form of options and stock grants, just as Jensen had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if Jensen was wrong?¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if CEOs don‚Äôt play much of a role in driving stock price performance, and the ‚Äúaligned incentives‚Äù of equity incentive pay don‚Äôt change behavior in any way that benefits shareholders?¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad&quot; id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-d665862078ae4631accf36cfb24349f7&quot; data-is-lazy=&quot;0&quot; data-is-responsive=&quot;1&quot; data-slot-variable-name=&quot;slotd665862078ae4631accf36cfb24349f7&quot; data-is-out-of-page-slot=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the ‚Äúbest and brightest‚Äù ‚Äî those executives with the most dazzling CVs and track records ‚Äî don‚Äôt perform any better than less credentialed executives?¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what if Jensen‚Äôs philosophy produced better outcomes for CEOs and business school graduates ‚Äî including those from his own school ‚Äî but not better outcomes for investors or society at large?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the past year,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we set out to answer these questions. We created a database of approximately 8,500 CEOs and their characteristics, each individually mapped to their respective companies for the duration of their tenure, and pulled company fundamentals from Compustat, stock returns from the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), CEO tenure and education from BoardEx, and long-form CEO biographies from Capital IQ. We then ran a battery of tests on the new data set, looking for correlation, persistence, and predictive power. We wanted to answer two sets of questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do CEO characteristics predict stock price performance? Do CEOs with MBAs perform better than CEOs without MBAs? Do CEOs with MBAs from the best MBA programs outperform other CEOs? Do CEOs who worked at top consulting firms and investment banks outperform other CEOs? More broadly, are the ‚Äúbest and brightest‚Äù better at running companies?¬†&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is CEO performance persistent? If someone was a successful CEO of one company and took over as CEO of a different company, does his or her performance at the first company predict performance at the second company? If a CEO does a good job for three years, does that predict stock price performance over the subsequent three years? More broadly, are some CEOs better than others at driving share price performance?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research has important implications for investing. There is broad consensus among investors that one should seek out ‚Äúwell-managed‚Äù companies. And what better way to assess the quality of management than to examine the chief executive‚Äôs resume and record?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad&quot; id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-2051d5d1ed0c44df8c8aaf7316ec7d1c&quot; data-is-lazy=&quot;0&quot; data-is-responsive=&quot;1&quot; data-slot-variable-name=&quot;slot2051d5d1ed0c44df8c8aaf7316ec7d1c&quot; data-is-out-of-page-slot=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach makes intuitive sense. Surely it is better to invest in the star CEO who has a record of stunning returns than a schmuck who has underperformed the S&amp;amp;P. Better still if the star was forged in the crucible of Harvard Business School. There is a big market for books about these genius CEOs and how they achieved their success ‚Äî and what lessons corporate executives and investors should take away from the histories of ‚Äúgreat men.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The siren songs of credentialism and tales of corporate &quot;great men&quot; are seductive. It is the pedagogy by which most college students learn and explain history. But if the data shows that CEO performance isn‚Äôt persistent, or if the resume characteristics we commonly associate with quality don‚Äôt, in fact, predict performance, are investors making a mistake in spending so much time on management quality?¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do MBAs Make Better CEOs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Jensen noticed a big shift in the career choices of Harvard MBAs. In the late 1970s, about 55 percent of graduates chose careers in corporate management, but by the late 1980s, only 30 percent were making this choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad&quot; id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-3d06c17f13114755b4b9160e505dd8e0&quot; data-is-lazy=&quot;0&quot; data-is-responsive=&quot;1&quot; data-slot-variable-name=&quot;slot3d06c17f13114755b4b9160e505dd8e0&quot; data-is-out-of-page-slot=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jensen was concerned that this meant America‚Äôs ‚Äúbest and brightest‚Äù leaders were not going to be running America‚Äôs largest companies ‚Äî and that corporate America needed to increase CEO compensation to lure more Harvard MBAs into corporate management careers.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central premise of business education is that leadership and management can be taught in the classroom. Harvard Business School says its mission is ‚Äúto educate leaders who make a difference in the world,‚Äù where a difference is defined as creating ‚Äúreal value for society.‚Äù And so, Jensen‚Äôs logic makes sense: Harvard attracts the very best students and, presumably, is good at educating them to be better business leaders, so corporate America should want more Harvard graduates running companies ‚Äî and this logic should extend to MBA programs beyond just Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regression results suggest a different result entirely. We tagged CEOs by the MBA programs they attended, formed monthly portfolios of companies broken down by the business school each CEO attended, and compared the returns of these portfolios to the broader market.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;67.090495162208&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found no statistically significant alphas ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;despite testing every possible school with a reasonable sample size&lt;/em&gt;. MBA programs simply do not produce CEOs who are better at running companies, if performance is measured by stock price return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;13.826955074875&quot;&gt;We ran similar regressions controlling for industry and found that ‚Äî even after controlling for industry ‚Äî elite MBAs did not produce positive statistically significant alpha. Elite MBAs did perform relatively well as CEOs in healthcare and consumer staples, but relatively poorly in energy and materials businesses, though those results were not statistically significant. Our study is not the only one to come to this conclusion. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1752563&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study by economists at the University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; asked similar questions and found that firm performance is not predicted by the educational background of the CEOs.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perceived quality of each institution appeared to have no correlation with stock price returns. Northwestern led with an alpha of 0.58 percent per month. Stanford eked out a barely positive alpha of 0.03 percent per month. Harvard and Wharton had negative alphas of -0.15 percent and -0.19 percent, respectively, per month. While these rankings likely occurred by sheer chance, they do nothing to support Jensen‚Äôs thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we looked at how CEOs who had previously worked at investment banks and elite consulting firms performed. If Jensen‚Äôs core thesis were true, we would expect CEOs with these elite credentials to outperform the market.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thus formed monthly portfolios for bankers and consultants. As we did with MBAs, we then ran industry-controlled Fama-French three-factor regressions. The result: Neither bankers nor consultants produced statistically significant alphas. We also back-tested portfolios designed to favor ex-bankers and consultants and found no significant edge (though consultants had a statistically insignificant edge on bankers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the ‚Äúbest and brightest‚Äù do not have a statistically significant edge when it comes to managing public companies. An elite pedigree ‚Äî the type of pedigree favored by headhunters and corporate boards ‚Äî is not predictive of superior management. One of the central rationales for Jensen‚Äôs campaign (increasing CEO pay by tying it to share price performance) appears, in retrospect, to have little empirical support. These credentials, however, are significantly overrepresented in the CEO biography database. The elite credentials thus benefit the individual, but there is little evidence that these credentials benefit shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs unclear precisely why the evidence suggests that highly credentialed CEOs from our most elite MBA programs and their funnel careers, like banking and consulting, appear to add no measurable value to shareholders. However, we found wisdom in a saying of the oldest living CEO, a 100-year-old billionaire from Singapore who still goes to work every day to mentor his son in leading the firm. His son, Teo Siong Seng, said, ‚ÄúMy father taught me one thing: In Chinese, it‚Äôs ‚Äòyi de fu ren‚Äô ‚Äî that means you want people to obey you not because of your authority, not because of your power, or because you are fierce, but more because of your integrity, your quality, that people actually respect you and listen to you.‚Äù¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg shows that ‚Äúthere is no education data available‚Äù for the 100-year-old CEO, Chang Yun Chung, so we cannot vet his educational credentials ‚Äî but we suspect he did not obtain an MBA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;68.894624312767&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;ad&quot; id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-44890dd43c414494a41526a802316ddf&quot; data-is-lazy=&quot;0&quot; data-is-responsive=&quot;1&quot; data-slot-variable-name=&quot;slot44890dd43c414494a41526a802316ddf&quot; data-is-out-of-page-slot=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is CEO Performance Persistent?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEOs‚Äô educational credentials might not predict success, but do their track records?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregg Lowe is a star CEO when measured by his consistency at generating shareholder value. He took over at Freescale Semiconductor in June 2012. Three years later, he managed the sale of Freescale to NXP Semiconductors for nearly four times the share price when he took over. In September 2017, he took over as CEO of Cree. The stock is up almost 60 percent since he became CEO, versus a flat S&amp;amp;P 500 over the same period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for every Gregg Lowe, there is an example on the other side.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Woolf led Cache from 2000 to 2008, earning investors a 5.8 times return on their investment over those eight years. He was hired five years later to be CEO of Body Central. The press release announcing his hiring cited his excellent leadership at Cache. But by January 2015, Body Central had closed every single one of its stores and investors had lost almost all their capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two opposing examples highlight key questions about corporate management: Is CEO performance persistent? Are some people simply better managers, able to consistently generate high returns for investors? And can we identify these people based on an examination of their track records?¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested these questions empirically. We looked first at performance persistence within companies: whether a CEO‚Äôs early track record predicts later performance. We filtered our database for CEOs who had tenures longer than six years at one company. We then separated each CEO‚Äôs return record into two buckets: Years 1‚Äì3 and Years 4‚Äì6. To eliminate the confounding effect of different market conditions, we adjusted returns by the performance of the S&amp;amp;P 500 index. Within each of the two time-horizon buckets, we sorted the CEOs‚Äô market-adjusted returns into quartiles. We then identified the CEOs who were above the median twice and those who were in the top quartile twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To interpret the results, it‚Äôs important to consider what we would expect to see by random chance. Similar to a coin flip, 50 percent of CEOs should be above-average performers, and 50 percent of CEOs should be below-average over each three-year time horizon. And just as a coin has a 25 percent chance of landing on heads twice in a row (50 percent x 50 percent), we should expect 25 percent of CEOs to be above average in both Years 1‚Äì3 and Years 4‚Äì6, purely by chance. But if we were to believe that CEO performance is always persistent, we would expect to see 50 percent of CEOs perform above average in the two successive three-year periods (50 percent x 100 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar calculation would apply to the top-quartile CEOs. If every CEO randomly has a 25 percent chance of being in the top quartile over a three-year period, then we should expect about 6 percent of CEOs to be in the top quartile in two successive three-year periods (25 percent x 25 percent) due to luck alone. If, however, there is full performance persistence, then 25 percent of CEOs would be in the top quartile in Years 1‚Äì3 and Years 4‚Äì6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual CEO performance results line up very closely with what we would expect to see by chance. Twenty-five percent of the 2,420 CEOs in our database had above-average performance in two successive three-year periods, and 7 percent of CEOs had top-quartile performance in two successive three-year periods.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;30.402649218002&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above figures are clear: There is almost no persistence in CEO performance. The observed number of CEOs in each category is indistinguishable from what we would expect if the process were entirely random. These results held when controlling for industry and the Fama-French factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualizations of the underlying return data tell the same story. Figure 3 below compares Years 1‚Äì3 returns to Years 4‚Äì6 returns. If the performance between these two periods were perfectly correlated, the data would form a 45-degree line.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div readability=&quot;43.332820906995&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart reveals no discernable relationship for CEOs in general. Historical performance does not appear to predict future performance, at least as measured by share price returns. The fourth-quartile results look very similar to the first-quartile results, implying that negative performance is no more persistent than positive performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;15.680638722555&quot;&gt;This is not an intuitive finding ‚Äî and academic studies suggest that this is not how boards think, particularly when it comes to firing bad performers. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/64421/1/__lse.ac.uk_storage_LIBRARY_Secondary_libfile_shared_repository_Content_Jenter%2C%20D_CEO%20turnover_Jenter_CEO%20turnover_2015.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; found that CEOs are often fired after bad firm performance caused by factors beyond their control, a finding in conflict with the standard economic theory of rational expectations. Boards are far more likely to fire CEOs when the industry is having trouble broadly, attributing to a person what is in fact an exogenous economic shock.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then looked at CEOs who have run multiple companies to see if their performance at the first company predicted outcomes at the second. Headhunters and corporate boards often look for CEOs with a track record of creating value at another company when choosing whom to hire. But if past performance doesn‚Äôt predict future results, then they might be looking at an irrelevant variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To investigate this hypothesis, we filtered our database for CEOs who have headed multiple companies. We then tagged each CEO-company pair with whether it was the first, second, third, or fourth company the CEO has headed. Because very few CEOs have headed more than two companies, we separated the data into two buckets: Company 1 and Company 2 (ignoring observations beyond the first two companies). To eliminate the confounding effect of different market conditions, we adjusted returns by the performance of the S&amp;amp;P 500 index. Within the two company buckets, we sorted the CEOs‚Äô market-adjusted returns into quartiles. We then identified the CEOs who were above the median twice and those who were in the top quartile twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, if outcomes were completely random, we would expect 25 percent of CEOs to be above-average performers across two companies (50 percent x 50 percent). Similarly, we would expect 6 percent of CEOs to be top-quartile performers across two companies (25 percent x 25 percent) by sheer luck. The actual CEO performance results are below.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Once again, there is little to no persistence in CEO performance from one company to the next. Again, these results held when controlling for industry and the Fama-French factors. The proportion of CEOs who continue to perform well is in line with what we would expect under random conditions.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;31.113749021654&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;70.623271588834&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So What?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is filled with depictions of visionary CEOs who have a record of generating extraordinary returns. An inordinate amount of journalistic effort is directed at dissecting their lives. What was his childhood like? What is his morning routine? What are his management principles? Does he use PowerPoint? The huddled masses clamor for these details in hopes of grabbing a piece of the star‚Äôs genius for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cult of the CEO is difficult to resist. Management, after all, is a team sport. Just as a quarterback can control the team's offense, the theory goes, so too can CEOs control their large public companies. If enterprise value has soared, it is because the CEO is a genius visionary. If multiples have compressed, it is because the CEO is an arrogant fool. And since the CEO is the key determinant of the company‚Äôs future, virtually any level of CEO compensation is justifiable.¬†&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beneath the mountain of CEO profiles are base rates that are virtually indistinguishable from randomness. The focus on the ‚Äúgreat man‚Äù theory of corporate management may lead to persistent errors. For investors favoring stocks with strong past-performing CEOs, the base rates suggest this is like betting on heads because the last two coin flips came up that way. If they pay up for this ‚Äúquality,‚Äù it‚Äôs worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;12.415094339623&quot;&gt;A &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2011/10/the-art-and-science-of-finding-the-right-ceo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2011/10/the-art-and-science-of-finding-the-right-ceo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, ‚ÄúThe Art and Science of Finding the Right CEO,‚Äù lists ‚Äúproven track record‚Äù as a top, ‚Äúobvious‚Äù criterion for selecting CEOs. But, to quote Sherlock Holmes, ‚ÄúThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.‚Äù¬†&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists, investors, and boards are placing excessive emphasis on CEO pedigrees and track records. In a world that is feedback-rich, stochastic, and ‚Äúfat tailed,‚Äù the simple narrative of the ‚Äúgreat man‚Äù does not appear to have much quantitative merit ‚Äî rather, it seems like yet another cognitive bias in the vein of those discovered by Daniel Kahneman.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we cannot prove that CEO credentials don‚Äôt have an effect on share price. It‚Äôs impossible to prove a negative ‚Äî what statisticians call a null hypothesis. We are simply pointing out that there is no convincing evidence in favor of rejecting that null hypothesis. U.S. companies adopted Jensen‚Äôs ideas without any data suggesting that incentive pay would actually result in better stock price performance ‚Äî and no evidence to suggest Jensen‚Äôs thesis was correct has emerged in the 29 years since that great experiment began.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective counterargument might be that share price return is not a good metric for CEO performance, that stock price is simply not within the control of the CEO, being driven to a large extent by factors like changes in investor sentiment and macroeconomic conditions.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;17.447653429603&quot;&gt;This thesis would, however, imply that incentive compensation tied to stock price is ineffective. That is a thesis ‚Äî unlike the elitist premise that pedigree predicts performance ‚Äî that is supported by data. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/in-the-money-what-really-motivates-executive-performance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P Global Report&lt;/a&gt; found no link between CEO pay and stock price performance. ‚ÄúDespite wide acceptance of executive pay-for-performance, we find no evidence that high levels of total incentive compensation (performance-based cash plus stock and stock option awards) result in higher-than-average shareholder returns,‚Äù the authors wrote.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham Lincoln famously said, ‚ÄúI claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.&quot; Very few of our CEOs are willing to make a similar confession about the share prices of the companies they run.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if there is no evidence that stock returns are attributable to CEOs, then what justification is there for their stratospheric pay? How much longer will investors and boards be fooled by randomness and hollow credentialism?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:title>The MBA Myth and the Cult of the CEO</og:title>
<og:description>Three decades ago, an influential Harvard Business School professor made the argument that CEO pay should be tied to stock performance. Was he horribly wrong?</og:description>

<title>Polar as a Personal Knowledge Repository</title>
<link>https://getpolarized.io/2019/03/01/polar-personal-knowledge-repository.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://getpolarized.io/2019/03/01/polar-personal-knowledge-repository.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/open-library.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to finally take the time and write up my long term vision of where Polar is headed as well as discuss some anti-goals (or at least secondary goals) of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar is designed around the idea of maintaining all your documents in one place, annotating them with highlights, comments, managing your documents with tags, and maintaining key extracted knowledge via spaced repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is a new class of application which we will see more players over the next decade - at least I hope so as competition is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar is a Personal Knowledge Repository (PKR) designed to maintain an external repository of everything critical to your education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes all your books, annotations, notes, and flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; mean a formal education though. If you want to load a text book into Polar for work and maintain the knowledge long term you should be able to do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you use your PKR the more value it has but additionally the greater risk that its failure would have a negative impact on your life and your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the company that runs your PKR goes out of business you‚Äôre entire education might be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you might still have a copy of the data you won‚Äôt be able to actually use the notes or at the very minimum your notes will have less value as they‚Äôre not exactly usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I went with the name Polar. Your repository essentially freezes and protects all your knowledge and maintains its integrity. A Polar repository is designed to follow through your entire career. Everything that you learn in college (or in your spare time) is kept in Polar to prevent forgetting key material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why spaced repetition is important. Without spaced repetition managing such a massive repository of information would not be manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-integrity&quot;&gt;Data Integrity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our primary goals is that you control the data and you can export at any time and the file formats used are self describing and easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they might not necessarily be an open standard (yet) you can export and easily write tools to migrate to another platform should you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we can sync with Anki but we also support export to markdown and have an elegant API for sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven‚Äôt exposed any 3rd party integrations outside of Anki just yet but our sync API should support systems like Evernote, Quizlet, OneNote, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be honest. If you retook your final exam from your high school calculus class would you pass?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you would if you were a mathematician or a math teacher but if your career is in politics (or an unrelated field) you would probably fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because everything we learn has a rate of decay. In computer science we call this ‚Äúbit rot.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, for neurological systems (AKA humans) if the neural connectivity isn‚Äôt regularly exercised - it‚Äôs lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put - you forget. Use it or lose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We force students to go through the gauntlet, pass the exams, then don‚Äôt care that they‚Äôve forgotten the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn‚Äôt make sense to get a degree just to forget everything you‚Äôve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted a lot of key material is kept but you lose key detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar is designed to combat this problem and it‚Äôs one of our primary goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar enables you to go heads down on learning complex topics without the worry that what you learn will just be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 I decided to do an experiment with Duolingo and see if I could teach myself a language in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a boy I developed a habit of reading while I was idle. If I was waiting a the DMV or in line to order a coffee I would read the news, politics, or listen to podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I felt that what I was learning wasn‚Äôt very valuable to my career or education in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest tech or political gossip has a finite shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, learning a new language, a new branch of mathematics, studying history&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;these things benefit you for the rest of your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if it was possible to learn this type of material without actually having to sit down and read a text book? What if it was possible to remember the material long term?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began just developing a habit of taking out Duolingo when I had a few minutes to kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were really amazing and convinced me that spaced repetition is an amazingly powerful and underrated tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In about a year of stealing 5-10 minutes here and there I was able to gain basic conversational skills in German. I now regularly listen to German podcasts and TV shows - though I admit that I‚Äôm still stuck on some grammar and issues with pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;collaborative-flashcards&quot;&gt;Collaborative Flashcards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this style of asynchronous learning is that without sitting down to study a text book you can‚Äôt make flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people in the SRS community feel that creating flashcards is a major part of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt doubt that this is true for many people, however, I think we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we broke apart a book into chunks, and each chunk was readable in isolation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we then (optionally) had flashcards associated with each piece of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading the text you could have the option to view the flashcard, and optionally import it into Polar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community could exchange these flashcards and vote on them and improve the quality over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way you could load an academic paper or textbook and it‚Äôs already pre-processed into a form that‚Äôs easily imported as either flashcards or as a threaded conversation with more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why social collaboration is very important to Polar and why we‚Äôve based the cloud functionality on Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firebase allows us to support basic cloud sync for the initial cloud functionality but for Polar 2.0 and 3.0 it will enable us to allow people to actively collaborate around documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes document discovery, sharing comments, highlights, and flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to add the ability to build high quality flashcards to enable people to improve them collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, adding audio, video, or image to flashcards can help with retention and adding memorization techniques like mnemonics can greatly improve their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that with the right dataset a great deal of this can be built via machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights, and comments can be used to find potential anchor points for flashcards. We can then use the community to build out the flashcards and extend them over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we‚Äôve made some of the core architectural decisions within Polar to be biased towards a hybrid offline + cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our users are from the ‚Äúoffline / free at any costs‚Äù camp and while I respect that it doesn‚Äôt enable us to build out the long term collaboration functionality I want to see in future versions of Polar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we can still have our cake and eat it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs nothing (at least right now) preventing Polar working completely in offline mode without using Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some users have complained about the use of analytics frameworks like Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I also appreciate their concern we‚Äôre only tracking high level events. Not only that, but you can audit the code if you‚Äôd like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might offer the opportunity to disable tracking as part of Polar Premium which would resolve that issue and still allow users to support Polar.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What you need may be ‚Äúpipeline +Unix commands‚Äù only</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nanxiao.me/en/what-you-need-may-be-pipeline-unix-commands-only/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Taco Bell Programming&lt;/a&gt; recently, and think this article is worthy to read for every software engineer. The post mentions a scenario which you may consider to use &lt;code&gt;Hadoop&lt;/code&gt; to solve but actually &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; may be a simpler and better choice. This reminds me a similar experience: last year a client wanted me to process a data file which has &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; million records. After some investigations, no novel technologies, a concise &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; script (less than &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; lines) worked like a charm! What surprised me more is that &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; is just a single-thread program, no nifty concurrency involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT field never lacks ‚Äúnew‚Äù technologies: cloud computing, big data, high concurrency, etc. However, the thinkings behind these ‚Äúfancy‚Äù words may date back to the era when &lt;code&gt;Unix&lt;/code&gt; arose. &lt;code&gt;Unix&lt;/code&gt; command line tools are invaluable treasure. In many cases, picking the right components and using pipeline to glue them can satisfy your requirement perfectly. So spending some time in reviewing &lt;code&gt;Unix&lt;/code&gt;command line manual instead of chasing state-of-the-art techniques exhaustedly, you may gain more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, if your data set can be disposed by an &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; script, it should not be called ‚Äúbig data‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
